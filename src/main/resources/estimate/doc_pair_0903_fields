On Friday , the Noble County Health Department announced with the Cole Center YMCA and Kendallville Park Department , which together put on the popular day camp , that Camp Wethonkitha would be shut down this week as a precaution after a camper showed cold-like symptoms following a family member testing positive for COVID-19 . In a brief Facebook post on Monday afternoon , camp runners confirmed that the student in question has also tested positive for COVID-19 . `` Sadly , our camper has tested positive , therefore it 's important that all staff and campers get tested and self-isolate until test results are back , '' the Kendallville Camp Wethonkitha post stated . `` If you have additional questions contact Dawn McGahen . Please keep our camper and their family in your prayers . '' On Friday , the health department said the camp was being suspended in order to allow all campers and staff to get tested for coronavirus . The camp originally was set to resume on July 6 if no campers tested positive , but it 's unclear at this time how the program will be affected . Casey Weimer , Cole YMCA executive director and CEO said the camp had 80 students enrolled . She said on June 23 when the camper was sent home with symptoms half of the campers were on a field trip limiting some potential exposure . Typically people who test positive and other `` close contacts '' identified for contact tracers are asked to quarantine for two-week periods in order to avoid potential wider spread of the virus . Local cases slow as state activity slows New cases of COVID-19 in the local area slowed over the weekend as Indiana carried through it 's normal weekend reporting lull . Noble and LaGrange counties both posted double-digit increases over the two days combined , while DeKalb and Steuben counties showed slower increases . According to the Indiana State Department of Health 's noon COVID-19 report , Noble County increased 14 cases since Saturday , rising to 431 overall . The county increased 10 cases on Sunday and another four on Monday . LaGrange County was behind that with 12 total cases , nine on Sunday and three on Monday . DeKalb County was up five cases over the two-day period , while Steuben County added only one . Indiana as a whole slowed a bit over the past two days , adding 355 and 298 cases on days when total tests processed also dropped over the weekend . Still , both days posted about a 5 % positivity rate , which has been around the daily average of 3-5 % for the last two weeks . The state logged just eight deaths combined over reports on Sunday and Monday , although death reporting almost always lags over the weekend . No new deaths were reported in the four-county area , with Noble County remaining at 28 , LaGrange County at six , DeKalb County at four and Steuben County at two . Indiana is poised to advance to Stage 5 , the final step of its Back on Track reopening plan on Saturday . Gov. Eric Holcomb is expected to announce whether the state can make that final step during a statewide press conference on Wednesday . Stage 5 would allow for full reopening of all businesses , attractions and events and removes limits on gathering sizes . While that stage would represent openness equivalent to pre-COVID-19 times , health officials have already warned Hoosiers that the state will still operate under public health recommendations like mask wearing and social distancing for a period of time afterward . Although Indiana has made continual progress and seen decreasing case counts and deaths , others part of the nation are surging right now to record new COVID-19 activity .", "seg_content_paragraph_starts": "0 27 82 106 164 190 220 237 264 297 304 327 350 389 407 425 483 507 539 584 645", "simhash": "ed1d2b37aa1502193f81e23870bf49e6", "spacy_content_loc": ["Kendallville", "Camp Wethonkitha", "Camp Wethonkitha", "Indiana", "LaGrange", "DeKalb", "Steuben", "Noble County", "LaGrange County", "DeKalb County", "Steuben County", "Indiana", "Noble County", "LaGrange County", "DeKalb County", "Steuben County", "Indiana", "Indiana"], "spacy_content_num": ["80", "half", "14", "431", "10", "four", "12", "nine", "three", "five", "only one", "355", "298", "5 %", "3-5 %", "eight", "four", "six", "four", "two", "5"], "spacy_content_org": ["KENDALLVILLE", "the Noble County Health Department", "the Cole Center YMCA", "Kendallville Park Department", "Facebook", "the health department", "Cole YMCA", "the Indiana State Department of Health", "Hoosiers"], "spacy_content_otr": ["Sadly", "Stage 5", "Track"], "spacy_content_per": ["Dawn McGahen", "Casey Weimer", "Eric Holcomb"], "spacy_content_tim": ["earlier last week", "Friday", "the popular day camp", "this week", "Monday afternoon", "Friday", "July 6", "June 23", "two-week", "the weekend", "normal weekend", "the two days", "noon", "Saturday", "Sunday", "Monday", "Sunday", "Monday", "two-day", "the past two days", "days", "the weekend", "both days", "daily", "the last two weeks", "Sunday", "Monday", "the weekend", "28", "Saturday", "Wednesday"], "spacy_title_loc": [], "spacy_title_num": [], "spacy_title_org": ["Camp Wethonkitha"], "spacy_title_otr": [], "spacy_title_per": [], "spacy_title_tim": [], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"JobsEducation": 0.876503050327301}, "second_cat": {"JobsEducation_Education": 0.876503050327301}, "third_cat": {"JobsEducation_Education_Other": 0.876503050327301}}, "title_c_count": 7, "tpc_m": {"t374": 0.1982073038816452, "t160": 0.11698773503303528, "t421": 0.1091533750295639}, "url": "https://www.kpcnews.com/covid-19/article_c62ab780-aa57-5f2e-8368-47bb6b9d15ab.html"}

As early as the '90s , Disney has been sneaking a little something extra for their fans after the movie magic has ended . It might be as something as simple as a goodbye to the audience , but it also might be something as grand as a massive musical number . Only one way to find out . 10 Hades 's Ranting -LRB- Hercules -RRB- Though nothing is actually seen at the end of Disney 's Hercules , there is a comedic surprise waiting for those who stayed through the credits . When fans saw Hades last , he was sinking into the swirling abyss of the River Styx . If they waited till after the credits rolled , they would have heard the slick-talking Lord of the Dead ranting about being left behind at the end of the movie in his snarky and sarcastic manner . 9 Look , an Undead Monkey -LRB- Pirates of the Caribbean : Curse of the Black Pearl -RRB- When the film first premiered , it was a rather surprising hit . A film based on the Disney Parks ride of the same name was a bit unusual , and so is this post-credits scene . Jack the Monkey was the unsung mascot of the franchise , and seeing him get his own skeleton form was both funny and frightening at the same time , but he was also a preview of things to come . It was a subtle hint , but one that paid off in the end . 8 Not So Shiny -LRB- Moana -RRB- Tamatoa is a criminally underrated Disney villain that definitely needs a little more love , and even he knows it . In fact , he even addresses the audience about his concerns . It 's one thing to still show the poor guy trapped on his back and wanting help , but when he goes as far as comparing himself to The Little Mermaid 's Sebastian , it becomes pure comedy gold . Even if he lacks Sebastian 's brand of charm . 7 Olaf Explains it All -LRB- Frozen II -RRB- Although it would have been easy to give Marshmallow and his tiara a free pass for this slot , it 's Olaf 's incredible performance at the end of Frozen II that takes the crown . Watching him reenact the first movie for the residents of Northuldra was funny the first time , but watching him do the second film for the snow creatures in Elsa 's ice castle was absolutely side-splitting . The pair of royals might be the face of the franchise , but if there 's any reason worth watching the films , it 's Olaf . 6 The Backson -LRB- Winnie the Pooh -RRB- Imagination is a powerful thing but sometimes it can get out of hand , and that concept is especially true for Pooh and friends when this giant creature comes stomping out of the woods . The Backson is introduced through his titular song , depicting a horrible monster , but the genuine article makes an appearance at the end of the film . Much to the audience 's surprise and delight , he 's actually quite an approachable -LRB- although clumsy -RRB- fellow . 5 Rick Ralphed -LRB- Ralph Breaks the Internet -RRB- This film was practically the perfect tribute to internet and meme culture , and that did n't stop even after the credits rolled . Anyone who has been baptized on the Internet knows about the ultimate troll move of Rick Rolling , and not even Disney could resist the opportunity . Die-hard fans who were expecting a preview of Frozen II were either angrily shocked or hysterically satisfied by Ralph doing a cover of Rick Astley 's `` Never Gon na Give You Up . '' Who needs `` Let It Go ? '' 4 Doing Nothing on the Beach -LRB- Christopher Robin -RRB- Although one Pooh project has already been featured prior , it would be absolute heresy not to include this positively perfect post-credits scene . Not because it hints at a future project , offers one last comedic jab , but features a performance by Disney Legend Richard Sherman , who was responsible for dozens of Disney songs including those in Winnie the Pooh . It 's simple , it 's charming , and it will satisfy any hardcore Disney buff . 3 The Screaming What ... -LRB- Mater and the Ghost Light -RRB- Pixar is loaded with post-credit content , and not just in their feature films . The Cars universe might be a bloated excuse to sell merch , but it 's kind of hard not to love Mater and the Ghost Light . It works not just because of its catchy country theme song and hilarious story , but for the appearance of a `` Screaming Banshee '' and Mater 's surprising reaction to the said monster . 2 Put That Thing Back Where It Came From Or So Help Me -LRB- Monsters Inc. -RRB- How many post-credit scenes involve a full Monster 's Inc. company musical ? What might seem like a cheesy throwback to Mike 's line in the film comes off as roaringly funny . Especially when the optic oddball casts himself in all the lead roles . One has to give the guy some credit for his creativity . 1 Pixar 's Blooper Reels -LRB- Various -RRB- Mike 's production was nothing compared to the blooper reels Pixar created for many of their post-Toy-Story features . Films like A Bug 's Life , Toy Story 2 , and The Incredibles had their own bloopers animated to completion by the Pixar staff and artists . Of course , one can always rely on this studio to forever show off their animation and imaginative prowess .

The large Independence Day celebrations we 're used to , complete with show-stopping firework displays , may be on hold this year in many places due to coronavirus . That means many people might be tempted to create smaller firework shows of their own and experts are worried . About 10,000 people were treated for fireworks-related injuries in 2019 and 73 % of those occurred around the Fourth of July , according to US Consumer Product Safety Commission . Handheld sparklers were the number one item behind those accidents . The CPSC wants to remind everyone on how to safely handle these potentially dangerous items this holiday weekend . They recommend first finding out what 's legal to use in your area . The CPSC also released the following tips to ensure everyone has a fun and safe time this Fourth of July : Never allow children to ignite or handle these items . Have a bucket of water or a hose nearby . Light fireworks one at a time , then back away quickly Never try to light or re-light malfunctioning fireworks Never point devices at people Douse fireworks in water before disposing of them .", "seg_content_paragraph_starts": "0 24 53 73 103 114 133 147 168 178 188 199 207 212", "simhash": "ee55aaf734c0c23f356862e38746be98", "spacy_content_loc": [], "spacy_content_num": ["About 10,000", "73 %", "one", "first", "one"], "spacy_content_org": ["CNN", "US Consumer Product Safety Commission", "CPSC", "CPSC", "Douse"], "spacy_content_otr": ["Independence Day"], "spacy_content_per": [], "spacy_content_tim": ["July", "just a few days", "this year", "this year", "2019", "the Fourth of July", "this holiday weekend", "this Fourth of July"], "spacy_title_loc": [], "spacy_title_num": [], "spacy_title_org": [], "spacy_title_otr": [], "spacy_title_per": [], "spacy_title_tim": ["Fourth of July"], "title_c_count": 9, "tpc_m": {"t765": 0.371116042137146, "t619": 0.4979526698589325}, "url": "https://www.keyc.com/2020/07/02/tips-safely-handling-fireworks-this-fourth-july/"}	{"_id": "0PTKkifT", "c_word": 440, "channels": ["Fire^^Department", "Open^^Fire", "Wis.", "Independence^^Day", "Financial^^Independence"], "countries": "us", "date": "2020-06-29 21:54:00", "domain": "wsaw.com", "epoch": {"$numberLong": "1593467640"}, "geotag": [{"name": "wausau", "score": 0.9970132112503052, "coord": "44.959135,-89.630122", "pid": "wausau,wisconsin", "type": "city"}, {"name": "merrill", "score": 0.9926053285598755, "coord": "45.180522,-89.683459", "pid": "merrill,wisconsin", "type": "city"}], "highlightkeyword_list": [["Wausau^^Fire", 0.37871377980473064], ["Nate^^Zellner", 0.36302375914283386], ["Scott^^Krause", 0.1002759969055256], ["WAUSAU", 9.244049200825205E-6], ["Merrill", 9.533571465602882E-7], ["Wausau", 6.657142539616131E-7]], "kw_title": ["Wausau^^Fire", "Wausau^^firefighter", "Fire^^Department", "Merrill"], "kws": ["Wausau^^Fire", "Wausau^^firefighter", "Fire^^Department", "Merrill", "Wis.", "Independence^^Day", "fireworks", "July^^celebrations", "Scott^^Krause", "precautions", "July", "home", "firecrackers", "paramedic^^Nate^^Zellner", "firework^^sales", "sparklers", "fountains", "this^^week"], "ne_content_location": {"Wis.": 1, "WAUSAU": 1, "Wausau": 2}, "ne_content_organization": {"Merrill": 1, "Merrill Fire Department": 1}, "ne_content_person": {"Scott Krause": 2, "Zellner": 3, "Nate Zellner": 1}, "ne_title_location": {"Wausau": 1}, "ne_title_organization": {}, "ne_title_person": {"Merrill": 1}, "paragraph_count": 15.0, "predicate_content": ["WAUSAU", "are", "come", "'s", "Do", "Think", "said", "booming", "means", "'s", "be", "include", "required", "said", "keeping", "try", "`", "Chalk", "said", "requires", "`", "recommend", "said", "means", "Make", "`", "said", "have", "was", "Let", "weekend", "said", "look"], "predicate_title": ["urge"], "seg_content": "WAUSAU , Wis. -LRB- WSAW -RRB- - A brat , dip in the pool , and fireworks are all part of the perfect 4th of July . But they do come with risks . That 's why both the Merrill and Wausau Fire departments are urging residents to take precautions in their 4th of July celebrations this week . `` Do things cautiously . Think about what you 're doing . Do n't take risks , '' Battalion Chief Scott Krause of the Merrill Fire Department said . With many firework shows canceled , firework sales are booming more that . That means more are launched at home , and there is more potential for danger . That 's why using them responsibly is key . Before you use fireworks , be sure the ones you are using are legal . Those include most that stay on the ground , like sparklers , fountains , and firecrackers . For the ones that leave the ground , a permit is required . `` Any of the big boomers that go up , that 's going to be more of the people that are certified , '' Wausau firefighter and paramedic Nate Zellner said . Other things to consider are keeping your distance from the explosion and making sure to only light one at a time . If there is a malfunction , do n't try to re-light it . `` Chalk that up as a financial loss . Definitely not worth relighting that thing , '' Zellner said . As for the brats and hamburgers on the grill , that requires some distance from your house . `` We recommend ten feet . And when it does come to ten feet from a structure , we also want that to be on a hard surface like concrete or asphalt , '' Zellner said . That means not on the grass and not near any combustible material . Make sure the propane tank does n't have any leaks and is not open for too long . `` If it does n't light within five seconds , shut the grill off , let it air out , and try again , '' Battalion Chief Scott Krause said . If a fire does erupt , have a fire extinguisher or a bucket of sand handy .

The site , home to a mechanic 's garage and several empty buildings , includes a former gas station . `` We need to find out what 's in the ground and what kind of clean-up we 'd have to do , '' said Adams , adding the company 's first planning board presentation could be as early as January . The store 's exterior will copy the architecture and green and white motif of the other stores . Its interior will give its local-centric produce department pride of place . `` It 's too early to say what other departments we 'll have or not have , '' Adams said .

Clint and Kasey Brooks opened the store after slowly building the honey and bee keeping portion of the Brooks Mill Farms business . Both he and his wife grew up on working farms . Brooks Mill Farms , which was started in the early 20th century , was Clint 's family farm . They raised grain and cattle and started growing a few vegetables . Back in 2015 , Clint decided to get a few bee hives on the farm to help pollinate the vegetable crops , he explained . As time went on , Clint -- who has a degree in biology -- gained more experience with bee keeping and they started harvesting the honey and wax . `` My wife and I had just been married and she was just like , ` Okay you are going to get some bee hives and that 's it . ' As it evolved she was wondering where it was going , '' Clint said . `` We started thinking , well we make honey and we have all this extra wax . And we toyed with the notion of making soaps and things like that . '' As they started making food and self-care products , they decided to go through with their first phase of expansion and began selling their merchandise at The Painted Owl in Midland and Nona Louise Embroidery in Locust . After selling at different locations and adding to their product line , Kasey and Clint decided that they needed to grow the business to keep it moving . `` We decided that , if we were going to do anything with this , we were going to need to make a decision on expanding so that we did n't stagnate , '' Clint said . The store is a major step for the business . Not only does it sell the farms honey and bees wax products , it has products from other vendors . Most of the vendors are local , Clint said . The vendors are : • Albemarle Sweet Shop • Donut Dinette • REL Coffee • Old School Mills • Johnny Fly • Blended and Blessed Bees • Catawba Hatchery • Ashe County Cheese • Two Moon Family Farms Keeping the products local was one of the couple 's major goals Clint said . They wanted the store to have an old country general store feel and having local products was a major part of that , he said . `` We opened this store because we wanted to create an environment of rustic passion where people can come in , sit out on the porch with a coke and just enjoy people , '' Clint said . While the store was able to open , it was slow work for a little while , Clint said . The COVID-19 pandemic has affected many supply chain areas and has caused many businesses and agencies to be short staffed . Things like getting the required inspections completed and having all of the product in store , took a bit longer than usual . Many days it was just Kasey and Clint organizing everything , but their family was always there to help . It was important to them , Clint said , that they also open and be mindful of people and their health . `` We see health as the number one priority . We ask that you only do what you feel comfortable doing , '' he said . Employees at the store -- who are mainly the Brooks ' family members -- practice social distancing and use sanitation measures when dealing with the products . Everyone working at the store also go through regular health checks . They also encourage all patrons to wear a mask , but they will not turn people away for not having one . The store is located at 596 NC Highway 24/27 in Midland and it is open Saturdays 7 a.m. -- 6 p.m. and Sundays 7 a.m -- 3 p.m. . During the week , the store is open by appointment Monday-Friday .", "seg_content_paragraph_starts": "0 34 57 99 153 231 269 297 334 364 378 382 385 388 392 395 400 403 407 412 453 491 532 575 597 623 662 684", "simhash": "eede4823e159f6fd722ce5bf3f5cf259", "spacy_content_loc": ["MIDLAND", "Midland", "The Painted Owl", "Midland", "Midland"], "spacy_content_num": ["first", "first", "Two", "one", "one", "596"], "spacy_content_org": ["Brooks Mill Farms", "Brooks Mill Farms", "Brooks Mill Farms", "Clint", "Locust", "• Albemarle Sweet Shop", "Donut Dinette", "Catawba Hatchery •", "Brooks", "NC Highway 24/27"], "spacy_content_otr": [], "spacy_content_per": ["John Crump", "Clint", "Kasey Brooks", "Clint", "Clint", "Clint", "Nona Louise Embroidery", "Kasey", "Clint", "Clint", "Clint", "Clint", "Clint", "Clint", "Kasey", "Clint", "Clint"], "spacy_content_tim": ["this past Saturday , June 27", "the early 20th century", "2015", "Many days", "Saturdays 7 a.m.", "6 p.m.", "Sundays 7 a.m -- 3 p.m.", "the week", "Monday-Friday"], "spacy_title_loc": ["Midland"], "spacy_title_num": ["first"], "spacy_title_org": ["Brooks Mill Farms"], "spacy_title_otr": [], "spacy_title_per": [], "spacy_title_tim": [], "text_category": {}, "title_c_count": 14, "tpc_m": {"t667": 0.10078294575214386, "t857": 0.1417880654335022, "t655": 0.12177861481904984}, "url": "https://independenttribune.com/news/local/honey-bees-and-more-brooks-mill-farms-opens-first-store-in-midland/article_e6eded48-ba2b-11ea-8e6c-0f052121b4ec.html"}

The remaining $ 4,000 will go toward Epworth 's Family Support Network program , which offers professional parenting education and mental health support . The funding will provide therapy kits delivered directly to clients ' homes so Epworth therapists can virtually play with youth during telehealth sessions in order to help them cope with this stressful time . The emergency fund also will allow Epworth to equip its youth with telephones and temporary internet services in order to support the technology needed to continue their virtual education . `` St. Louis County Children 's Service Fund is an outstanding partner and helps make our mission possible , '' said Epworth President and CEO Dr. Michael Panicola . `` We particularly appreciate the leadership and agility CSF has shown from the beginning of this public health emergency and ca n't thank them enough for all they have done both now and throughout the years .

In a highly competitive application process , Hays-Caldwell Women 's Center -LRB- HCWC -RRB- made the cut . `` It was really competitive this year so receiving any funding was wonderful , '' HCWC Director of Community Partnerships Melissa G. Rodriguez said . `` Especially now , some funders are shifting and restructuring their funding because of COVID-19 . '' Hays-Caldwell Women 's Center in San Marcos plans to use the grant funding as part of their capital campaign , building 18 units of transitional housing for victims , as well as classrooms and childcare centers for 0-5-year-olds . The construction was jump started by a $ 275,000 grant from the St. David 's Foundation in early 2020 . HCWC cited domestic violence as the leading cause of homelessness in women and children and noted that youth exposed to domestic violence can suffer life-long consequences and up to a 20-year shorter life expectancy . Both transitional housing and affordable child care were listed in TCFV 's Texas State Plan as two of the greatest barriers to victims trying to leave an abusive relationship . The agency was selected by TCFV as one of 22 domestic violence service providers for the $ 250,000 2020 Swalm Grants , funding transitional housing development , quality childcare , technology purchases and more as they deal with the economic hardship and increased violence caused by COVID-19 . Individual grants range from $ 2,250 to $ 15,000 and come from TCFV 's Swalm Endowment Fund . Swalm grantees are selected annually in a competitive application process by at-large TCFV board members . This year , priority was given to applicants that specified a need related to COVID-19 or a service area highlighted in the Texas State Plan , a report TCFV published in 2019 to identify the biggest gaps in domestic violence services . `` I 've never seen a greater time of need for domestic violence victims and agencies than the one COVID-19 has induced , '' said CEO of TCFV Gloria Aguilera Terry . `` Texas has experienced an increase in domestic violence hotline calls during the pandemic , and we know that economic distress hinders victims from leaving life-threatening relationships . This year , agencies ' needs were so great that TCFV awarded more Swalm Grants than usual , and each amount was given with the hope and expectation that it would save Texas lives . '' This year , nearly half of the 48 applications submitted were selected for funding of at least 50 % of the applicant 's requested amount . Three agencies in particular exemplified the most urgent needs of the year , among them Hays County . Denton County Friends of the Family reported a 36 % increase in crisis hotline calls since stay-at-home orders were put in place . It will use the Swalm Grant to improve telehealth services and shift resources online , making advocacy and counseling more accessible to clients who can not attend in-person appointments because of COVID-19 concerns or because of Denton County 's lack of public transit . The agency will also add text availability to its crisis hotline , knowing that victims under constant surveillance of their abuser might not be able to call for help .

Roy Cooper 's fiscal 2021 amended budget proposal includes $ 2,000 in bonuses for teachers and principals as well as bonuses for school support staff and higher education employees . About $ 85 million of that $ 360 million in bonus payments would be taken directly from the state 's private school voucher fund , which provides scholarships to lower-income students to attend private schools . `` The budget I propose takes on the challenges of today while building for the promise of tomorrow , '' Cooper said . `` We have to rise to the occasion of this pandemic response now and focus on ways to emerge from this crisis stronger than before . '' The plan immediately received backlash from Senate Republicans , who have been at odds with Cooper over state spending . Sen. Deanna Ballard , R-Watauga , who co-chairs the Senate Education Committee , said Cooper 's plan to appropriate unused funds from the private school voucher program reduces the chances for lower-income children to receive a better education . `` Under the governor 's ` equity ' plan , only the wealthy can attend private school , '' Ballard said . Cooper last June vetoed North Carolina 's biennium budget , causing the General Assembly to allocate one-time expenses through piece-meal legislation , while recurring costs were funded at previous levels . Lawmakers plan to return to the General Assembly next week to review the fiscal 2021 plan , and significant changes are expected . Cooper 's amended budget also includes another attempt at Medicaid expansion , which in part led to last year 's budget standoff , with Republicans sternly opposed . Cooper also wants to spend a $ 457 million windfall from last fiscal year that came after more people paid their income taxes in fiscal 2020 than expected after a three-month tax payment deadline extension during the pandemic . The Senate 's chief budget writer , Sen. Harry Brown , R-Onslow , said Tuesday that spending the money would be `` irresponsible , reckless and negligent . '' A similar move by former Gov. Bev Perdue after the last recession led to layoffs and pay cuts for teachers , Republicans said . State budget director Charlie Perusse said Wednesday he was not concerned that future cuts will result from Cooper 's amended budget . `` We have a balanced budget in fiscal year 2021 . We 've had one based on the actions taken by the Legislature in May and June , '' Perusse told reporters . `` When we do a revised consensus forecast , we anticipate -- hopefully -- it might be a little bit better than we originally anticipated . '' Among other things , Cooper 's plan allocates $ 86.5 million to match federal relief funds for local areas affected by recent natural disasters . Cooper also proposed increasing weekly state unemployment benefits from $ 350 to $ 500 and from 12 weeks to . He also laid out a plan for the remaining $ 900 million in the state 's Coronavirus Relief Fund . Hoping to take advantage of the low-interest rates during the current economic climate , Cooper also recommends the state invest in a $ 988 million limited obligation bond to support health care advances , including vaccine development . He also proposed placing a $ 4.3 billion bond referendum on the 2021 November ballot for schools , higher education , infrastructure projects and affordable housing .", "seg_content_paragraph_starts": "0 53 89 139 159 198 220 251 274 302 341 370 394 416 476 501 541", "simhash": "3528f77f4d790235558b449e961963de", "spacy_content_loc": ["The Center Square", "North Carolina 's"], "spacy_content_num": ["2,000", "About $ 85 million", "$ 360 million", "one", "$ 457 million", "one", "$ 86.5 million", "$ 350 to $ 500", "$ 900 million", "$ 988 million", "$ 4.3 billion"], "spacy_content_org": ["Republicans", "Senate", "Republicans", "the Senate Education Committee", "Cooper", "the General Assembly", "the General Assembly", "Cooper", "Medicaid", "Republicans", "Senate", "Republicans", "Cooper", "the Legislature in", "Perusse", "Coronavirus Relief Fund", "Cooper"], "spacy_content_otr": [], "spacy_content_per": ["Roy Cooper", "Cooper", "Cooper", "Deanna Ballard", "Watauga", "Cooper", "Ballard", "Cooper", "Harry Brown", "Bev Perdue", "Charlie Perusse", "Cooper", "Cooper"], "spacy_content_tim": ["fiscal 2021", "today", "tomorrow", "last June", "next week", "fiscal 2021", "last year 's", "last fiscal year", "fiscal 2020", "three-month", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "fiscal year 2021", "May and June", "weekly", "12 weeks", "2021 November"], "spacy_title_loc": [], "spacy_title_num": ["$ 457M"], "spacy_title_org": ["Medicaid"], "spacy_title_otr": [], "spacy_title_per": ["Cooper"], "spacy_title_tim": [], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"PoliticsGovernment": 0.9695503115653992}, "second_cat": {"PoliticsGovernment_Municipal": 0.9695503115653992}}, "title_c_count": 13, "tpc_m": {"t459": 0.4080405831336975, "t43": 0.13684840500354767, "t818": 0.12370854616165161}, "url": "https://www.matthewsminthillweekly.com/news/2020/08/gov-cooper-plans-to-spend-457m-unbudgeted-funds-expand-medicaid/"}	{"_id": "0PTOaIYX", "c_word": 436, "channels": ["State^^Budget", "Senate^^Budget", "Federal^^Budget", "Budget^^Deal", "Fiscal^^Year"], "countries": "us", "date": "2020-06-29 23:51:49", "domain": "fox47news.com", "epoch": {"$numberLong": "1593474709"}, "geotag": [{"name": "lansing", "score": 0.983608067035675, "coord": "42.732535,-84.555535", "pid": "lansing,michigan", "type": "city"}], "highlightkeyword_list": [["Gretchen^^Whitmer", 0.8735830636362917], ["Mike^^Shirkey", 0.38067606665078035], ["Lee^^Chatfield", 0.37136653891782306], ["Leadership", 1.1793584181120546E-6], ["Michigan", 1.0981569480556476E-6], ["Apple", 1.0379605954357954E-6]], "kw_title": ["state^^budget", "Budget^^Deal", "Fiscal^^Year", "Governor", "Leadership", "current^^year", "Majority^^Leader"], "kws": ["state^^budget", "Budget^^Deal", "Fiscal^^Year", "Governor", "Congress", "Leadership", "federal^^funds", "crucial^^funding", "current^^year", "reductions", "governments", "CARES^^Act^^funding", "House^^Speaker", "Majority^^Leader", "school^^districts", "expected^^expenses", "schools", "community^^colleges", "businesses", "COVID-19^^expenses"], "ne_content_location": {"LANSING": 1, "Mich.": 1, "Michigan": 1}, "ne_content_organization": {"Congress": 1, "Senate": 1, "Apple": 1, "House": 1, "School Advisory Council": 1}, "ne_content_person": {"Mike Shirkey": 1, "Gretchen Whitmer": 1, "Lee Chatfield": 1}, "ne_title_location": {}, "ne_title_organization": {}, "ne_title_person": {}, "paragraph_count": 12.0, "predicate_content": ["LANSING", "Tonight", "-LRB-", "Clarklake", "-LRB-", "announced", "reads", "is", "provides", "is", "are", "cut", "details", "equal", "allocate", "set", "is", "be", "waiting", "continues", "Want", "Visit", "Stay", "Download", "Select", "Breaking"], "predicate_title": ["Announce"], "seg_content": "LANSING , Mich. -- Tonight , Gov.

In this time of crisis , it is our responsibility to come together and build a budget that reflects a bipartisan commitment to the things we value most as Michiganders . This agreement provides crucial funding for Michigan families , schools and communities grappling with costs incurred as a result of the virus . `` Our collective priority is a healthy state and a healthy economy . We are committed to working together to address the remaining shortfalls in next year 's budget and we are looking to our partners in Congress for support to help maintain the essential services relied upon by our families and small businesses . '' Under the agreement , $ 256 million will be cut from the foundation allowance and $ 60 million cut from categoricals . The details on which categoricals are still being worked out . The foundation allowance cut will equal approximately $ 171 per pupil . The state will then allocate $ 512 million in CARES Act funding for school districts for COVID-19 expenses and expected expenses around returning to school this fall . The Return to School Advisory Council recommendations are set to be announced tomorrow afternoon . There is also a $ 500 per person hazard pay allocation for each teacher across the state totaling $ 53 million that is also paid for with CARES Act funding .

Larry Hogan . Hogan announced the expansion from the first face-covering rule , issued on April 18 , during a Wednesday coronavirus briefing , after Maryland reported the highest number of hospitalizations in over a month . Hogan attributed the increasing hospitalizations to a rise in cases of those 40 and under but was quick to note that the state 's positivity rate overall is still below 5 % . The effort follows a similar order from D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser , who recently mandated that residents should be wearing masks when they exit their homes , enter restaurants and business , or are even work in an open office space . Hogan defines a face covering as one that fully covers a person 's nose and mouth and is secured to the person 's head , but does not have to be a medical-grade mask . `` The term `` Face Covering '' includes , without limitation , scarves , bandanas , and plastic full-face shields , '' Wednesday 's order reads . Due to the rise in hospitalizations , Hogan said that Maryland is pausing the roadmap to recovery , staying in Phase 2 for the time being . In addition to stronger mask guidelines , Hogan also advised against out of state traveling when possible and strongly urged Marylanders to avoid travel to states with a 10 % positivity rate or higher . Those states include : Florida Texas Georgia Louisiana Arizona Alabama South Carolina Nebraska Idaho LaNeta Roth , the owner of an indoor mini-golf course and family entertainment center in Charles County , said she 's happy with the decision . `` I 'm 100 % for it , '' Roth said . `` We 're in the middle of a pandemic , and I think people really need to take it seriously . '' She said her staff has implemented rigorous safety measures since they reopened in June , including requiring customers to wear masks at all times inside . `` I do n't want to get sick , and I do n't want anyone else to get sick , '' Roth said . `` So , we do have sanitizer stations set up at Scary Strokes . We offer gloves for people to wear , and we do require people when they come in to have their mask on . '' She hopes that taking these extra precautions will allow for her business to stay open -- because even though customers have returned , they 're still making a fraction of their typical profit . `` I do understand about businesses being open though , '' she said . `` We are a small business , and it 's very hard when your business is shut down how you 're going to maintain keeping this afloat after the pandemic is over . '' A gym owner in Prince George 's County , Deanna Robinson , said she supports wearing masks , but she is concerned about people potentially having to wear them while working out . `` Being kind of in the health and wellness space , I 'm all for doing whatever is going to help the community at large , so I 'm definitely for wearing masks , '' Robinson said . `` I will say that it definitely will pose some heavy restrictions for people in the gym. : She said her classes at Fab Body Factory in Upper Marlboro are high-intensity interval training and would pose a safety risk for members to wear masks while working out . The governor 's order does say that there 's an exception `` while swimming or engaging in other physical activities where the use of a Face Covering is likely to pose a bona fide safety risk . '' Robinson said they have cut down capacity and socially distance participants by about 12 feet during classes . `` I like to think of it as a lot of the people that are expiring because of COVID have pre-existing conditions , so in the gym , we are kind of combating that by helping people lower their blood pressure , lower their cholesterol , '' she said . `` So we are combating it from that standpoint as well , but we do want to make sure we 're doing it safely and doing it as safely as we can .

Without healthy roots , your cannabis will never thrive . Roots are in charge of water retention , nutrient absorption , anchoring the plant , and also facilitate vegetative growth . All of these functions must be considered when choosing a container . For a root system to develop and thrive , they will need the following : Drainage : Water retention is paramount for healthy plants -- without it , your cannabis will wither and die . But too much water will waterlog your plant and lead to root rot , killing roots . Oxygen : Plant roots require oxygen to function properly . Choose a container that facilitates enough oxygen for root development without overexposing them to the elements -- containers do this though various styles of perforation . Nutrients : Roots require optimal conditions for nutrient absorption to occur . This includes pH balance , optimal temperatures , and nutrient availability . Space : Roots need plenty of space to branch out . A container that is too small will cause it to become rootbound and choke the plant . Check out these additional resources on soil and planting : What 's the best soil for growing marijuana ? Common pots used for cannabis growing Garden centers and grow supply chains offer different pots that vary by material composition , shape , size , and perforation style . Traditional plastic containers Standard plastic containers are a popular option for growers operating on a budget . These pots are inexpensive , but still provide the essentials for your plants . Pros : Low overhead costs Solid drainage -LRB- plus it 's easy to add more holes -RRB- Transplanting is easy and inexpensive Cons : Inability to protect root systems from temperature fluctuations Lack of durability which can cause cracks and structural damage over time May have airflow issues depending on the grow medium Ceramic pots Otherwise known as terra cotta , ceramic pots offer a unique set of benefits to growers in hot climates . Pros : Absorb moisture and retain lower temperatures during hotter days Heavy weight helps to anchor larger plants Cons : Less than optimal drainage ; drilling holes into clay pots is possible but requires special tools and is more labor-intensive Heavy weight makes it difficult to transport plants Fabric containers A relatively new innovation in container gardening , roots in fabric pots grow to the outer edges and attempt to bypass the porous fabric wall . Instead , they are cut back , allowing new growth to occur . This process , called `` air pruning , '' results in a denser root composition which promotes healthy growth and development . Pros : Promotes dense , healthy root systems Increased airflow to the roots Excellent drainage ideal for carefully-maintained gardens Cons : Requires more attention and maintenance as the pots dry out quickly . Note : you can use larger pots to help slow drying out . Flimsy structure can make plant support challenging This post was originally published on March 13 , 2018 .

The Orange County Health Care Agency -LRB- OCHCA -RRB- does not report hospitalizations or deaths from the virus by city , but it is known that an outbreak occurred at the homeless shelter temporarily located in Fullerton 's Independence Park . Countywide , 145 people are known to have lost their lives to the COVID-19 virus to date ; nearly 6,000 infections have been reported . OCHCA assiduously notes that nearly 1,000 of those cases have occurred in skilled nursing facilities and jails , which have each experienced rising infection rates . For the first time , the County has begun to include numbers of individuals known to have recovered from the virus , although the information is not considered to be of specific epidemiological value because it is difficult to track . Partially Reopening Orange County Just before Memorial Day , the county of Orange submitted a Variance Assessment application to the state of California . They issued a press release on Saturday , May 23 , announcing that the State had accepted the application , allowing a partial reopening of many businesses as long as they adopt safe practices for social distancing . The following are now permitted to open if they follow the State 's guidelines : • In-person dining reservations • Retail shopping with social distancing and curbside pickup • Manufacturing • Offices -LRB- when telework is not possible -RRB- • Outdoor Museums • Limited Services Even hair and beauty salons can open as long as everyone wears face coverings , but no procedures that involve the touching of faces are allowed . Church services , funerals , cultural services , and protests are permitted , but only if they involved fewer than 100 people outside . Inside , no more than 100 people may gather , or 25 % of a venue 's normal capacity , whichever number is smaller . Weddings with groups are still not allowed and private gatherings should be limited to those sharing the same household . College courses must follow distance learning protocols , regardless of lab requirements . Many other businesses and activities are still forbidden , like nail salons , bars , gyms , sport clubs , gymnastics centers , dance/ballet studios , Little League and all other sports camps , and private and public schools . Swimming pools , even in private developments , can not open . John Wayne Airport continues to operate . According to the County 's press release , OC was able to move into Stage Two of the State 's four stages of opening by meeting the following requirements : `` Fewer than 5 % of daily COVID-19 hospitalizations over a seven-day period , or no more than 20 COVID-19 hospitalizations on any single day in the past 14 days . -LRB- The State 's prior requirement that a county not have a single death in the past 14 days was removed . -RRB- Fewer than 25 new cases per 100,000 residents in the past 14 days , or less than 8 % testing positive in the past seven days . Have a capacity to be able to test 1.5 per every 1,000 residents and at least 15 staff per 100,000 county population trained and available for contact tracing . Hospital capacity for a possible surge of 35 % of hospitalizations due to COVID-19 cases in addition to providing usual care for other patients . '' Health Care Officer 's Order On the same morning the County was allowed to partially reopen , Dr. Nicole Quick , OC 's County Health Officer , released a detailed and prescriptive countywide order reiterating the need for persons with COVID-19 to self-isolate -LRB- except to receive medical care -RRB- for at least 72 hours after recovery and at least 10 days following the appearance of first symptoms , a 10 day isolation period for anyone testing positive for the virus but not showing symptoms , and self-quarantining for 14 days of anyone in close contact -LRB- within 6 feet for at least 15 minutes -RRB- for an individual known or likely to have COVID-19 . The self-quarantine rules do not apply to healthcare or law enforcement professionals . Dr. Quick 's order also included a detailed checklist for the partial reopening of businesses . Most controversially , the order proscribed that , with the exception of children under the age of 2 and others who might be incapacitated or have a health condition that precluded it , `` All Orange County residents and visitors shall wear a cloth face-covering when : -LRB- i -RRB- in a public place ; -LRB- ii -RRB- visiting a retail , commercial , or other place of business ; or -LRB- iii -RRB- at work , and when the resident or visitor is not able to maintain at least 6 feet of physical distance from another person who is not a family/household member or lives in the same living unit . `` -LRB- A superseding order , issued on May 26 by Dr. Quick , removed the specified places for the wearing of face coverings with a simple , `` Outside their home when they are not able to maintain at least 6 feet of physical distance from another person who is not a family/household member or does not reside in the same living unit . '' -RRB- Dozens of people complained in person to the Board of Supervisors -LRB- BOS -RRB- during their regular meeting on May 26 about the face covering requirement , some not seeming to realize that wearing a face covering is for the purpose of preventing a person from spreading COVID-19 through infectious droplets at least as much as it is to avoid catching it the same way . One complainant threatened Dr. Quick , drawing immediate condemnation from County officials . Not all members of the BOS itself were supportive of the face covering section of the order , but , because Dr. Quick 's authority derives directly from the State , were unable to modify or cancel it . BOS Chair Steel did n't seem to understand , at least prior to Dr. Chau 's repeated explanations , that persons who might not be aware that they had the virus and exhibit no symptoms at all can easily spread it to others . Dr Chau also related his own experience receiving many communications from County residents urging him to show support for the order . OC Sheriff Don Barnes announced that he would not enforce the face covering order , saying that his department was `` not the mask police , '' and preferred a strategy of educating the public about the importance of wearing face coverings . The County has reopened parking lots for beaches and wilderness parks , but maintains the importance of social distancing while enjoying these amenities . How the County is Spending CARES Act Funds OC 's Board of Supervisors defeated a proposal by Chair Michelle Steel and Sup . Don Wagner to send $ 75 million made available to the County from the federal CARES Act directly to businesses hard hit by the closing necessitated by the pandemic . Instead , each of the five supervisorial districts will receive an equal share of the funding , where their respective supervisors will independently decide how to distribute the funds . Sup . Steel announced that she would send the $ 15 million for her district to the constituent cites within it , proportioning it according to the populations of the cities . Fourth District Supervisor Doug Chaffee 's -LRB- Fullerton -RRB- office is developing different criteria for dispersal of funding , instead relying on a local office of the Small Business Development Center , to which businesses would presumably need to apply for support . The County is also spending CARES Act funds on a mobile testing unit being put to use for testing congregate living facilities such as skilled nursing facilities , jails , and group homes , all of which are at heightened risk because of the close proximity of inhabitants to one another . Skilled Nursing Facilities and Jails State officials recently instituted a requirement that all patients in skilled nursing facilities be tested for COVID-19 . The County 's testing procedures have been modified accordingly , with all jail staff being tested as well as increased cleaning of facilities . Late in the afternoon on May 29 , OCHCA revealed a serious error in communicating test results from patients in an OC skilled nursing facility . Ten patients given tests by the County 's own health lab on May 18 were erroneously reported to have tested positive for COVID-19 . All were transferred to a restricted COVID-19 patient unit , needlessly exposing them to patients who had actually tested positive for the virus . The mistake evidently was not discovered for ten days . All ten patients were retested for the virus . Of the ten , only one was now positive for it . That patient remains in a COVID-19 unit , but is not reported to be showing any symptoms of the disease . The other nine patients were transferred to a quarantine unit for fourteen days . The County would not reveal the name or location of the facility affected , citing privacy concerns . OCHCA Director Dr. Clayton Chau said that the County is auditing every step of its communications process to determine how the error occurred , and was unwilling to speculate about it until the completion of the review . He stressed that the lab results themselves were accurate . The relatively small number of cases involved was not enough to affect the County 's partial opening status . Homeless Shelter Outbreak County CEO Frank Kim revealed on May 28 that 13 homeless individuals had tested positive for COVID-19 across two different homeless shelters , one in Anaheim and one in Fullerton . Although Kim did not specify which shelters were involved , the only one operating in Fullerton is the one that was formerly housed in the Armory on Brookhurst , and now has been temporarily moved to the gymnasium at Independence Park on Valencia Ave. Further investigation by The Observer confirmed that two cases had occurred at the Independence Park facility , operated by Mercy House , who also operates the Bridges at Kraemer shelter in neighboring Anaheim . It is not known if that is the same Anaheim shelter where 11 clients tested positive for the virus . Independence Park , where the nearby swim center is partially open , is not accepting new applicants . Clients currently residing there are not allowed to leave . All have been tested for the virus . According to OCHCA , none of the homeless individuals who tested positive have died from the virus . One staff member tested positive . The County did not say in which facility the staff member was working , but did say that they had not identified a link between infections at the two facilities . The clients who tested positive from both shelters were sent to motel rooms through the County 's Project Roomkey , which utilizes State funding to rent vacant hotel rooms for homeless individuals . There they will receive isolation and recovery services .", "seg_content_paragraph_starts": "0 4 152 156 229 233 242 244 253 256 259 335 427 457 511 538 567 593 598 722 917 996 1101 1144 1168 1176 1326 1378 1383 1425 1583 1650 1653 1782", "simhash": "e2492307d2512a3b3e287a7a75c7d8ef", "spacy_content_loc": ["Orange County", "Fullerton", "Independence Park", "County", "California"], "spacy_content_num": ["200", "145", "nearly 6,000", "nearly 1,000", "first", "fewer than 100", "no more than 100", "25 %", "Two", "four", "no more than 20", "Fewer than 25", "100,000", "less than 8 %", "1.5", "1,000", "at least 15", "100,000", "35 %", "first", "6 feet", "at least 6 feet"], "spacy_content_org": ["Statistics Fullerton 's", "The Orange County Health Care Agency", "OCHCA", "OCHCA", "State", "State", "Little League", "OC", "State", "State", "OC", "County Health"], "spacy_content_otr": [], "spacy_content_per": ["John Wayne Airport", "Nicole Quick", "Quick", "Quick"], "spacy_content_tim": ["the end of May", "Just before Memorial Day", "Saturday , May 23", "daily", "seven-day", "any single day", "the past 14 days", "the past 14 days", "the past 14 days", "the past seven days", "at least 72 hours", "at least 10 days", "10 day", "14 days", "at least 15 minutes", "the age of 2", "May 26"], "spacy_title_loc": ["Orange County 's"], "spacy_title_num": [], "spacy_title_org": ["Partial Reopening and Health"], "spacy_title_otr": [], "spacy_title_per": [], "spacy_title_tim": [], "text_category": {}, "title_c_count": 8, "tpc_m": {"t851": 0.11389268189668655, "t848": 0.3565005660057068, "t238": 0.14172178506851196}, "url": "https://fullertonobserver.com/2020/05/30/orange-countys-partial-reopening-and-health-orders/"}	{"_id": "0PTOdnpZ", "c_word": 292, "channels": ["County^^Police", "County^^Officials", "Department^^of^^Health", "Police^^Officials", "Health^^Officials"], "countries": "", "date": "2020-06-29 23:17:00", "domain": "nixle.com", "epoch": {"$numberLong": "1593472620"}, "geotag": [{"name": "contra costa county", "score": 0.9778203964233398, "coord": "37.853409,-121.901795", "pid": "contra_costa_county,california", "type": "county"}], "highlightkeyword_list": [["Danville", 1.0906052662591508E-6]], "kw_title": ["Danville", "Police"], "kws": ["Danville", "county^^health^^officials", "Police", "Health^^Officials", "Contra^^Costa^^County", "Health^^Services", "hospitals", "July", "coronavirus", "July^^weekend", "COVID-19^^patients", "testing", "positive^^COVID-19^^tests", "facial^^coverings"], "ne_content_location": {"Contra Costa County": 2}, "ne_content_organization": {"Reopening Timeline Contra Costa Health Services": 1}, "ne_content_person": {}, "ne_title_location": {}, "ne_title_organization": {"Danville Police Department": 1}, "ne_title_person": {}, "paragraph_count": 7.0, "predicate_content": ["Postpone", "announced", "increased", "gone", "showed", "asking", "is", "are", "call", "is", "asked"], "predicate_title": ["CA"], "seg_content": "County Health Officials Postpone July 1 Reopening Timeline Contra Costa Health Services announced Monday that the planned reopening of businesses set for July 1 will be delayed due to a continuing spike in the number of new coronavirus cases .

For those businesses that are open , the best way to support them is by maintaining good social distancing and wear facial coverings while waiting in line or inside a business .

Now 13 years old , it has sold more than two million cars globally . It 's no small matter , then , that you 're looking at an all-new successor . The imaginatively named New 500 brings pure-electric power to Fiat 's dinky fashionista , courtesy of a 42kWh battery and 117bhp electric motor that powers the front wheels . Underneath is a new EV-specific platform . It was developed by Fiat before the -LRB- still ongoing -RRB- merger with PSA was confirmed , and is a scalable platform that houses the water-cooled , Samsung lithium-ion batteries along the floorpan -- in the 500 's case , slightly towards the back of the chassis with a concentration of cells beneath the rear seats . The new underpinnings have grown a bit compared to the existing 500 , which will continue to be sold alongside the New 500 , offering a petrol alternative to the electric version for the foreseeable future . If plug-in is what you 're after , you 're getting a 500 that 's bigger by some 6cm in width and length , and has also gained a 22mm longer wheelbase . That 's resulted in more room inside , which is great news since the ICE 500 -LRB- which we 'll refrain from calling the Old 500 -RRB- is far from commodious , even by small car standards . Our favourite new camper van is not a VW By Chris Haslam As a result , the New 500 now offers more shoulder room inside as well , as there is much more seat and wheel adjustment , so the Fiat New 500 is now comfortable for normal human-sized humans even on a longer journey , which could n't be said of its predecessor . You might well be willing to undertake a long journey in the New 500 given its official WLTP range of 199 miles , and an 85kW peak rapid charging speed . That results in a te to 80 per cent top-up in around 35 minutes if you can find a CCS ultra-rapid charging station of 100kW or more , or around 30 miles of range added in five minutes . Currently , most rapid-charging stations on UK motorways are 50kW , which will do the same 80 per cent top-up in around an hour , while a 7kW home wallbox will fully charge the New 500 in around six hours . The ` My Remote ' app also allows you to control your charging and nav route from your phone . We 'd still recommend that you plan your charging stops in advance of a long trek in an EV , but with the Fiat offering usefully more range than chief rivals such as the Honda e and Mini Electric there 's a good chance that a lot of motorists could live with the Fiat New 500 as their sole car . Is the Audi A8 TFSI e the best luxury hybrid yet ? Is the Audi A8 TFSI e the best luxury hybrid yet ? 9/10 By Jeremy White Which could go some way to justifying the price . Orders open in the UK in October 2021 , but only for the top-spec Convertible la Prima that we have been driving here in prototype form around Turin . That 'll set you back # 29,000 after the # 3,000 government grant , while a hatchback la Prima follows not long after and will cost # 26,995 . Wait a few months more into 2021 and lower spec versions of the New 500 will start to arrive , potentially bringing prices down as low as # 22,000 -- although this could be for a smaller battery , lower range version if the knowing smiles of the Fiat executives were anything to go by as they suggested we `` wait until October '' , when asked about smaller battery variants . That puts it into contention with everything from the VW e-Up ! and co , through to the posh-but-pricey Mini and Honda already mentioned . And the Fiat 's got a good chance of mopping up a lot of sales from both ends of that spectrum , going on the evidence of our Italian pre-production experience . For a start , the New 500 is unmistakably evolutionary , yet is also distinctly different . Those full LED headlights that bi-sect the clamshell bonnet are the most striking new feature , but there are plenty of neat touches including protruding ` torpedo ' side indicators that hark back to the iconic 1957 Fiat 500 . The vent-less grille also has design roots in the rear-engined original . The interior has plenty of retro features , too , from the rounded dash architecture to a central cubby between the front seats that Fiat 's vice-president of design , Klaus Busse , says `` lends a more romantic feel and makes it feel almost bench-like '' . Those retro details are tempered with super-modern touches like push-button door releases and upholstery that 's made from recycled ocean-waste plastic . It all combines to make the 500 feel grown-up yet still cheerful and characterful . Polestar 2 review : the best EV there is right now 9/10 By Jeremy White And finally , it feels more up-to-date as well . Mostly thanks to the new Uconnect 5 infotainment system , which perches a 10.25-inch touchscreen on top of the dash as a window to Android Auto and wireless Apple Carplay . Two phones can be linked simultaneously , and other standard features include TomTom satnav , Bluetooth , USB connections , wireless phone charging and over-the-air map updates . There is also the option to add Alexa voice control to the system . Our prototype car 's touchscreen worked well and bodes well for screen responsiveness , as long as the fussy menu layouts are addressed . The systems we used were n't the finished article , so we 'll refrain from delivering a formal verdict -- but it is safe to say that , prototype or not , this system is the Millennium Falcon to the older 500 's bi-plane . The way the New 500 drives has also been refreshed . Although 117bhp does n't sound like much , the 220Nm of torque gives it fun , zippy pick-up off the line , and the seamless ebb and flow of acceleration that you get with single-ratio electric drive is just ideal for a wieldy city car like the New 500 . And it is wieldy , too ; light steering and a turning circle of 9.6 m means that you can execute cheeky u-turns or navigate awkward car parks with smug ease , although in the Cabrio the terrible rear visibility -LRB- literally non-existent if you have the pram-style hood scrolled all the way down -RRB- can be off-putting in tight quarters . At least the 360-degree parking camera that la Prima models get goes some way to helping out with visibility . Apple and BMW 's digital car key hints at the future of the iPhone By Jeremy White Our main issue with the way the New 500 drives is its ride comfort . Although the damping softens the worst of the bumps around town , you get a lot of chatter over coarse surfaces and high-frequency creases in the road , and the short wheelbase will hop and thump over big potholes and the like . It 's unlikely to be a deal-breaker , and our cabrio 's 17-inch wheels certainly wo n't have helped -- the smaller 16 - and 15-inch wheels that will arrive on cheaper models will likely make for more relaxing about-town transport . Three drive modes are offered , which also control the two brake-regen ' modes . Normal offers a very mild regenerative braking setting that is barely noticeable and lets the New 500 glide quite freely off the throttle . Range mode and the delightfully named Sherpa mode both deliver one-pedal driving , which -- as on the Nissan Leaf and Honda e -- is a setting designed to remove the need for the brake pedal around town . It 's said to increase potential range and efficiency by up to 30 per cent , with Fiat reckoning that in extreme circumstances you could get 290 miles from the 500 in Sherpa mode -LRB- when air-con , power and top-speed are all limited -RRB- . Our car was reading a maximum range of around 170 miles on a route taking in mostly fast-flowing urban traffic , so even in Sherpa we reckon you 'd struggle to get that sort of range unless you do a significant portion of it behind a tow car . Even so , the one-pedal drive mode in the 500 is quite easy to judge , and you can comfortably negotiate sticky urban traffic on the throttle alone . Overall , the New Fiat 500 is a smart evolution of a car that 's as much national treasure as transport -- arguably as much in the UK as in Italy , given how much we love the big-eyed 500 . Jaguar 's updated I-Pace has a beefed up charging system By Jeremy White Sure , it 's unlikely to win favours with those who carry rear passengers -LRB- even children -RRB- very regularly , since the back seats are pretty cramped . The boot space -LRB- in the convertible , particularly -RRB- is very limiting , too , even if it does have underfloor space for one or other of the standard Type 2 and three-pin domestic charging cables -- you wo n't get both under there . Yet , given the range and equipment on offer , the New 500 still represents decent value in the context of its rivals , especially when those cheaper variants materialise . It 's a classic , made modern and tech-savvy without losing its classless appeal . And if that does n't sell , we are forced to wonder what will . More great stories from WIRED Ca n't focus ?

Central , Memorial and West all earned the chance to play after the Manchester Board of School Committee approved regional competition for fall high school sports categorized as `` high risk '' -- football and cheer . The vote , taken at 1:21 a.m. on Tuesday near the end of a marathon meeting , was 11-2 , with Arthur Beaudry and James Porter opposed . Board members took their action after hearing Athletic Director Christine Pariseau-Telge 's plans to play high school sports as safe as possible in a coronavirus pandemic , as well as input from local health officials . `` Balancing all things , I think we 're in a position where we can move forward with this , '' said Phil Alexakos , chief operating officer for the Manchester Health Department . Then there was an `` X '' factor , too , namely West senior star gridder Xavier Burpee , whose letter to the board made a difference for at least one member , Leslie Want . In the letter , Burpee pleaded for any kind of a season in hopes of improving his visibility to college recruiters and a chance for a scholarship . `` I 'm not a ` school ' type of kid , but I go because I love playing football and the thrill of it , '' wrote Burpeee . `` Yes , we know there will risks but that 's just the game of football . It 's not fair to the kids like me who go to school for sports . Things could be rough for someone at home and sports may be their only way out . '' Want said she was initially opposed to allowing football . But after hearing from Burpee , Pariseau-Telge and the health department , `` I 'm convinced to support this , '' she said . On Tuesday afternoon , Want said it was the hardest vote she 's ever taken in her five years on the board . `` I have no doubt if something happens , we 'll pull back immediately , '' she said . `` But it 's up to the students and their families to make sure that if they want to play , they 'll have to be responsible at home . And I think their coaches are emphasizing that , too . '' Before his `` no '' vote , Beaudry cited concerns with guidelines set by the Centers for Disease Control that urge distancing . `` How are they going to do that ? '' asked Beaudry . Earlier in the meeting , board members approved a proposal by Pariseau-Telge to hire three hourly employees -- one for each high school -- to serve as `` COVID managers '' to ensure players , coaches and a limited number of fans for games observe safety protocols at the fields . Over a six-week fall season , Pariseau-Telge estimated the bill at about $ 2,000 , the cost defrayed by savings generated from less-frequent team travel in the fall and a lost spring season , she said . The proposal passed with only Mayor Joyce Craig opposing . Pariseau-Telge explained to the panel that she has been meeting regularly with the New Hampshire Athletic Directors Association to communicate site-specific safety precautions and game schedules . `` ADs will provide information to each other the week before we play , '' she explained . Regarding attendance at outdoor games , the board approved Pariseau-Telge 's plan for a system of two tickets , intended for immediate family members , to be distributed to each student-athlete . No fans will be allowed at girls ' volleyball matches , which will be played in gymnasiums . On Tuesday afternoon , Pariseau-Telge explained how sports schedules might look in the fall . The state 's Division I ADs , she said , have agreed upon a four-region geographical setup for most competition . Division I Central and Memorial teams will play each other and also Goffstown , Concord and possibly Bedford , if that town ultimately approves football . The goal is for each school to play only one other school per week -- with soccer teams playing a home-and-home series -- much like Pinkerton Academy and Londonderry do during Mack Plaque week . Central and Memorial will be seeking two more football opponents to round out a six-game schedule , Pariseau-Telge said , and since the NHIAA has allowed for nonleague play -LRB- and open tournaments -RRB- , she has contacted Mike Connell , the AD at Division III Trinity about a city game . Trinity is the defending state Division III champ . Pariseau-Telge expects Division II West to be able to play mostly Division II teams in all sports . Athletic directors from that division are meeting later this week to formalize regional setups . Non-football teams such as field hockey , soccer and volleyball can expect to play 10 games each , she said .

Unlike other New England states , New Hampshire does not have an overarching requirement that people wear facial coverings . Instead , the state has universal guidelines that say they are required under some circumstances . For example , universal guidance found on NH.gov states : `` Employees and volunteers who are directly providing service to consumers or individuals must wear masks while providing such service . ` Providing service ' examples include explaining information to consumers or individuals in person , interacting with consumers by showing or providing products/services in person , registering individuals in person , or any other interaction where maintaining social distancing is difficult . '' The guidance says `` must , '' but in some local businesses , customers are seen wearing masks , while the staff is not . Others strictly adhere to the requirement . On Aug. 13 , Gov. Chris Sununu signed an order authorizing civil penalties for violating any `` emergency order , rule , or regulation issued under the State of Emergency . '' At Bootleggers Footwear , manager Bob Belk , said masks are uncomfortable but feels the business needs to comply with state regulations . `` When it 's warm like yesterday , you feel like you ca n't breathe , '' he said . `` They 're sort of a pain . '' One advantage of wearing a mask is that it encourages customers to wear them as well , he said as a customer approached the cash register without one on . In addition to the state 's universal guidelines , it has offered industry-specific guidance . The food service industry rules state , `` Direct customer contact employees shall wear cloth face coverings over their nose and mouth when at work and around others in settings where social distancing may be difficult -LRB- e.g. serving clients , greeting , etc. -RRB- . '' Restaurant customers are supposed to wear masks on the way to and from their tables . Associate Attorney General Anne Edwards said the rule that customer-contact employees must wear masks is an example of a mandatory requirement that can be enforced , while the guidance involving customers is a discretionary recommendation . A quick look inside the always popular Soda Shoppe restaurant in downtown Laconia showed customers tucking into their meals , while masked waitresses moved from table to table , filling up coffee cups and taking orders . But at the new restaurant , Trillium Farm to Table , owner Hanah Rush was taking customer orders without wearing a mask . Tables at the restaurants have been spaced out to allow social distancing , but none of the staff members wore a mask . Rush said she did n't want to talk about the issue of face masks . At All My Life Jewelers , there were three customers and three staff members . The customers were wearing masks , but the workers , who were taking money and waiting on people , did not wear masks . Owner Suzanne Bullerwell said she has a policy of not talking to reporters . Edwards said retail staff members who ring up sales and wait on customers are required to wear masks . Her office has fielded about 175 complaints over potential violations of the state COVID-19 requirements over the last few months , but none have progressed to the actual imposition of civil penalties . Business owners tend to comply once they are educated about the rules . Jim Daubenspeck , owner of Daub 's Cobbler Shop , was sitting on a stool outside his store . He said it does n't make sense for him to wear masks for hours at a time , when customers are fairly infrequent . He said the materials involved with shoe repair may put him in a vulnerable group for COVID-19 . `` We 're back there sniffing glue all day , '' he quipped . He said he keeps a mask handy in case a customer wants him to put one on . Myles Chase , owner of MC Cycle & Sport , also said he tries to be amenable to his customers . He was n't wearing a mask . `` It 's whatever everyone is comfortable with , '' he said . The staff at Meredith-based Energysavers , which sells wood stoves and hot tubs , did not wear masks while waiting on customers . The same was true at nearby Sundance Spas .

The former three-sport standout at Westview High School became a first-time mother in January when she and her husband , Robbi Koors , had their first child , a little girl named Ramsey James . `` Under normal circumstances , I would have had to go back to work after 12 weeks when my maternity leave would have been up . With the coronavirus shutdown , I was able to spend every day of her first seven months with her , '' said Koors , who is an assistant volleyball coach and head recruiting coordinator for the Ball State women 's volleyball team . `` I feel very fortunate to have been able to spend so much time with her at this early point in her life . `` Ball State has been great working with me . I am the first person on the volleyball coaching staff to have a child . '' Even though the Mid-American Conference has suspended fall sports and is looking into the possibility of playing in the spring of 2021 , Koors is getting ready to return to the campus in Muncie . `` Classes begin Monday . Some classes will be all in the classroom , some all online and some a combination of the two , '' Koors said . `` There is a system in place if we have to go all online if we need to . '' With students returning to campus that means Koors will also be back on campus . `` This past week was the first time I have taken Ramsey to daycare to get her adjusted for when I do go back to work , '' Koors said . `` I live in Carmel and it 's a 55-minute drive to Muncie . That is another reason why I was so happy Ball State was willing to work with me . '' Just because Koors has been at home does n't mean she did n't keep busy on her job . `` Recruiting never stops . We do a lot of recruiting during the club volleyball season which is usually in the spring and summer , '' Koors said . `` Due to the coronavirus shutdown , we did a lot more of the recruiting online . `` One thing we have going for us is that in our next class -LRB- 2021 season -RRB- we do n't need a lot . We also tend to do a lot of our recruiting regionally . But it will give us more on a plate that is already pretty full . '' Since the MAC has canceled fall sports , there is talk of moving them to the spring . `` Whether or not we have a spring season has not been announced . That is up to the NCAA DI Board of Governors , '' Koors said . `` If that does happen we will basically flip-flop what we do in the fall and the spring . We will spend more time this fall on recruiting and then time in the spring playing the season . `` If we do play a season in the spring I think it would be a MAC-only schedule . And even with that , there could be problems . I do n't think as of now we could play Buffalo because we are not allowed to travel to New York and they would not be allowed to come here . '' Ever the optimist , Koors sees one advantage to holding the season off until the spring . `` It would be good for our incoming freshmen , '' she said . `` Instead of giving them the normal two weeks to adjust to college life , classes and our program now they would get an entire semester to acclimate themselves . There is a lot of getting ready to be on the road . Things like traveling together as a team , eating meals together and staying in hotels . `` One of the things we have talked to with the upperclassmen is how in this type of situation we really need them to be leaders by example . This is something that will make us stronger . '' The schedule could look different with the spring season . `` We could have to adjust to playing more mid-week matches , '' Koors said . The Ball State administration has a plan in place for allowing students to return to campus . `` Every student is going to have to be tested and get a negative result before being allowed on campus , '' Koors said . `` For the athletes , there will be a screening process every day before practice , which will involve having their temperature taken and filling out a questionnaire . '' Koors was a three-sport -LRB- volleyball , basketball and track and field -RRB- athlete at Westview before enjoying a four-year volleyball career at Purdue University , where she was named a First Team All-Big Ten selection and an AVCA Honorable Mention All-American as a senior in 2011 . Her senior season the Boilermakers posted a 29-5 overall record , 16-4 in the Big Ten . Purdue advanced to the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament before a 26-23 , 21-25 , 25-20 , 25-19 loss to Florida State ended the season . Koors -LRB- Fisher -RRB- was second on the team with 15 kills behind Ariel Turner 's 16 . She began her coaching career as a student assistant at Purdue before moving on to the College of Charleston , where , in her three-year tenure as an assistant coach , the Cougars won a pair of Colonial Athletic Association regular-season titles , the 2013 CCA tournament championship and a berth in the 2013 NCAA Women 's Volleyball National Championship tournament . Koors joined the Ball State coaching staff for the 2016 season . `` I am excited to welcome Tiffany back to Indiana and into the Ball State family , '' current head coach Kelli Miller Phillips said in a press release on the school 's website . `` Her playing and coaching experiences have prepared her to make an immediate impact on our program . She is a fierce competitor who will bring the best out of our players . '' She won three letters in volleyball , four in basketball and four in track and field at Westview and was an all-state honoree in each of the sports . The 6-foot-2 middle blocker played in 401 games -LRB- 115 matches -RRB- in her career -LRB- 2008-11 -RRB- for the Boilermakers . She finished her career with 902 kills , 64 aces , 204 digs , 31 solo blocks and 322 assisted blocks .", "seg_content_paragraph_starts": "0 28 63 156 182 217 266 281 345 364 410 463 481 548 609 626

Paulding High School , organized a virtual clinic for his Dallas school featuring numerous coaches , including several with Dalton connections . It 's critical not to waste time during the pandemic , but , rather , continue to learn , grow and improve , said Dyer , who is also North Paulding 's assistant principal . `` We 're going to come out of this , either better or worse , because you do n't stay still . '' Speakers for the Zoom clinic included Tony Ingle , who has served as the head coach for men 's basketball teams at both Dalton State College and Kennesaw State University ; Larry Mangino , director of scouting and recruiting for the 2019 national champion University of Virginia men 's basketball team ; Steve Prohm , Iowa State University 's men 's basketball coach and a Northwest Whitfield High School alumnus ; and Sam Purcell , associate coach for the University of Louisville women 's basketball team and a Southeast Whitfield High School alumnus . Dyer , a longtime basketball coach before he ascended to the athletic director role , considered what he would want from a clinic as a coach , then set out to create that type of workshop . `` As a coach , we 'd talk about that ` reset mindset , ' '' and at North Paulding , the school focuses on the extra 1 % , how much `` little things matter , '' he said . All the speakers used that notion , that `` getting a little better every day makes the difference , '' as a base for their individual topics . `` Everyone was outstanding , '' especially Prohm , who was `` fantastic , '' Dyer said . `` He did such a great job . '' Also superb in the online clinic was Jon Gordon , a best-selling author and speaker , Dyer said . `` It was amazing , because -LRB- Gordon -RRB- does n't usually do things like this . '' Purcell discussed the power of a contagious attitude , and how , during difficult times like the pandemic , `` you have to invest in yourself , '' said the Auburn University alumnus . `` Pour in more knowledge for yourself . '' `` You ca n't inspire others unless you can inspire yourself , and players can see that , '' Purcell said . `` If you get yourself right , players will recognize that and be more motivated . '' It 's pivotal to remain positive in the face of adversity , a point he emphasized with Louisville 's players , he said . While they did n't get to play in the NCAA tournament this year and compete for a national championship due to the pandemic shutdown , they did play more than 30 games , which is better than spring sports `` that never got going . '' Ingle concurred , noting he prefers to look at these `` challenging times '' as `` times for opportunity , -LRB- rather than -RRB- times of adversity . '' `` If you take away my struggles , you take away my chances for growth , '' Ingle said . Or , as one of Ingle 's heroes , legendary former UCLA men 's basketball coach John Wooden , said : `` Do n't let what you do n't have interfere with what you can do . '' Ingle long admired Wooden , who won 10 NCAA national championships in a 12-year period as head coach at UCLA , including a record seven in a row , and he even visited the coach at his home in California , where the Presidential Medal of Freedom winner taught Ingle another valuable lesson . Ingle asked Wooden about the legacy he hoped to leave , and the coach did n't mention any of his on-court triumphs , he said . Instead , he wanted his epitaph to be simply : `` He really cared . '' In four-plus decades of coaching at various levels of basketball , Ingle believes all of his players knew he `` loved them and cared about them , '' he said . `` I just love people . '' `` Coaches are carriers -LRB- who -RRB- carry kids and help them find the greatness in them , '' he added . `` That 's why I coached . '' Ingle has been a head coach at five levels of basketball in Georgia , and as an evaluator , he looks for three things in players . `` Are they coachable , are they a good fit , and do they love the game ? '' he said . `` If you just like it , you wo n't make it . '' However , `` if your dream is big enough , then any obstacles will be small enough to overcome , '' he said . `` Keep going until you reach your dream . '' Ingle overcame adversity in his own life , severely injuring his knee in the 1973 national tournament while playing at what is now Dalton State College , but was then a junior college . His team lost that game by one point , and as he prepared to fly to Chattanooga for surgery , `` I felt I had let everyone down . '' `` I felt I owed Dalton a national championship , '' and , decades later , he delivered , coaching Dalton State to the NAIA national title in 2015 , he said . The reaction from the public to that championship `` surpassed even my dreams . '' Reaction to the spring clinic from those who joined the Zoom conference has been overwhelmingly positive , Dyer said . `` It was a huge pickup for everyone and huge for my mental health , too . '' That was n't Dyer 's only virtual outreach effort , either . For example , `` we also had -LRB- Atlanta Braves shortstop -RRB- Dansby Swanson talk to our seniors of our spring sports in our virtual ball field , '' and `` we did a virtual signing -LRB- day -RRB- at out school , '' he said . Swanson 's appearance was a surprise to students , which made it even more special to them , as he `` talked about adversity and bouncing back . '' As for the virtual signing day , `` I 'll never forget the day I signed '' to play basketball at Maryville University in St. Louis , `` because I never thought it would happen , -LRB- and -RRB- I wanted those kids to have the same opportunity , '' Dyer said . Roughly 20 North Paulding athletes signed , and `` it was uplifting for these seniors who already have had so much taken from them '' this spring and summer due to the pandemic . Dyer is also planning to open up his Zoom for questions from students , coaches , parents , etc. , this summer for a couple of hours each week , he said . `` It 'll be like when you drop by my office for a few minutes to check in and chat . '' At 36 , Dyer is one of the youngest athletic directors in the state , and while he misses coaching , he 's ecstatic in his new role , he said . `` I got my doctorate a couple of years ago , and when this -LRB- job -RRB- opened up , I knew it was time . '' He remains connected with Dalton , and he 's grateful for everything he learned growing up in this area , he said : `` I do love Dalton .

Focusing on refining the wonders of virtual reality and other electronic displays even further , researchers from the Nano Hybrid Technology Research Center of Korea Electrotechnology Research Institute -LRB- KERI -RRB- , a government-funded research institute under National Research Council of Science & Technology -LRB- NST -RRB- of the Ministry of Science and ICT -LRB- MSIT -RRB- , have created nanophotonic 3D printing technology for screens . Meant to be used with virtual reality , as well as TVs , smartphones , and wearables , high resolution is achieved due to a 3D layout expanding the density and quality of the pixels . Led by Dr. Jaeyeon Pyo and Dr. Seung Kwon Seol , the team has published the results of their research and development in `` 3D-Printed Quantum Dot Nanopixels . '' While pixels are produced to represent data in many electronics , conventionally they are created with 2D patterning . To overcome limitations in brightness and resolution , the scientists elevated this previously strained technology to the next level with 3D printed quantum dots to be contained within polymer nanowires . Powered by light or electricity , dots light up in an array of colors which then translate into the appropriate display . Usually , pixels are covered in a light film for creating a better display , with the ability to see images more clearly ; in this research though , the KERI scientists decided to eliminate the film coating in place of a 3D structure , featuring pixels with a lateral dimension of 620nm and 10,000 nm in height . `` The 3D structure enabled a 2-fold increase in brightness without significant effects on the spatial resolution of the pixels , '' explained the researchers in their abstract . `` In addition , we demonstrate individual control of the brightness based on a simple adjustment of the height of the 3D pixels . '' With the potential for printing onto polyimide -LRB- PI -RRB- or polyethylene terephthalate -LRB- PET -RRB- , flexible platforms can also be fabricated for use with wearables or other devices , including those that may require a rollable display . `` It is not easy to find cases of using 3D printing techniques to the display industry across the world . We took a different approach from previous 3D printing research , which was mostly relying on foreign tools and equipment , '' said Dr. Jaeyeon Pyo . `` It can be considered as a complete technology independence to develop an ` integrated solution ' from 3D printing materials to original technology and equipment .

A Stanford-led team has invented a way to store data by sliding atomically thin layers of metal over one another , an approach that could pack more data into less space than silicon chips , while also using less energy . The research , led by Aaron Lindenberg , associate professor of materials science and engineering at Stanford and at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory , would be a significant upgrade from the type of nonvolatile memory storage that today 's computers accomplish with silicon-based technologies like flash chips . UC Berkeley mechanical engineer Xiang Zhang , Texas A&M materials scientist Xiaofeng Qian , and Stanford/SLAC Professor of Materials Science and Engineering Thomas Devereaux also helped direct the experiments , which are described in the journal Nature Physics . The breakthrough is based on a newly discovered class of metals that form incredibly thin layers , in this case just three atoms thick . The researchers stacked these layers , made from a metal known as tungsten ditelluride , like a nanoscale deck of cards . By injecting a tiny bit of electricity into the stack they caused each odd-numbered layer to shift ever-so-slightly relative to the even-numbered layers above and below it . The offset was permanent , or non-volatile , until another jolt of electricity caused the odd and even layers to once again realign . `` The arrangement of the layers becomes a method for encoding information , '' Lindenberg says , creating the on-off , 1s-and-0s that store binary data . To read the digital data stored between these shifting layers of atoms , the researchers exploit a quantum property known as Berry curvature , which acts like a magnetic field to manipulate the electrons in the material to read the arrangement of the layers without disturbing the stack . Jun Xiao , a postdoctoral scholar in Lindenberg 's lab and first author of the paper , said it takes very little energy to shift the layers back and forth . This means it should take much less energy to `` write '' a zero or one to the new device than is required for today 's non-volatile memory technologies . Furthermore , based on research the same group published in Nature last year , the sliding of the atomic layers can occur so rapidly that data storage could be accomplished more than a hundred times faster than with current technologies . The design of the prototype device was based in part on theoretical calculations contributed by co-authors Xiaofeng Qian , an assistant professor at Texas A&M University , and Hua Wang a graduate student in his lab . After the researchers observed experimental results consistent with the theoretical predictions , they made further calculations which lead them to believe that further refinements to their design will greatly improve the storage capacity of this new approach , paving the way for a shift toward a new , and far more powerful class of nonvolatile memory using ultrathin 2D materials . The team has patented their technology while they further refine their memory prototype and design . They also plan to seek out other 2D materials that could work even better as data storage mediums than tungsten ditelluride . `` The scientific bottom line here , '' Lindenberg adds , `` is that very slight adjustments to these ultrathin layers have a large influence on its functional properties . We can use that knowledge to engineer new and energy-efficient devices towards a sustainable and smart future .

Today IPPA kicked off the Iowa Pork Crawl Freestyle , a summer promotion that encourages customers to enjoy pork at eateries around the state . Participants can dine in , carry out or have their meal delivered , then share photos of their food on social media channels for a chance to win prizes . The contest runs through Aug. 30 . Rules are simple : Order an entree featuring pork from your choice of five different Iowa food establishments , including restaurants , vendors and food trucks . Pork must be the main ingredient , such as a pork chop , a breaded pork tenderloin , pork tacos , a BLT or pork ribs . To be entered for prizes , snap a photo of yourself with each of the five dishes , and share all five photos in a post on Facebook , Twitter or Instagram . Tag @Iowa Pork , tag or list the five restaurants you visited , and use the hashtag #IowaPorkCrawl . For every five pork entrees and restaurants visited , participants can post again for more chances to win . `` Iowa Pork values our relationships with foodservice entities across the state , and it has been a tough couple months for both them and our farmers , '' said Kelsey Sutter , IPPA 's marketing and programs director . `` This program is aimed to celebrate the resilience and perseverance of both . '' Bars and restaurants have seen a dramatic hit in business because of COVID-19 , and some have permanently closed . In March , Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds -- like leaders in many other states -- ordered a mandatory shutdown of public dining areas to help slow the virus 's spread across the U.S. . According to Jim Murray , national channel marketing and innovation manager with the National Pork Board , nearly every state has since reopened their foodservice operations in some capacity , though customers may experience limited or simplified menu options . `` We are excited about this summer program , as it benefits all Iowa restaurants that offer pork , it 's simple and the prizes are fun , '' Sutter said . The first 25 individuals who correctly share a completed Iowa Pork Crawl will win a pork swag bag that includes a T-shirt , a meat thermometer , an Iowa Pork can koozie and $ 10 in Pork Cash that can be redeemed for fresh pork products at most major Iowa grocery retailers . Once the crawl ends , two participants will be randomly selected to each win a grand prize valued at $ 500 . One package features a catered party for up to 20 guests , with pork among the meat offerings , while a YETI explorer package includes a YETI cooler , two YETI Rambler ® Tumblers , $ 100 in Pork Cash and a $ 25 gas card .

The county board voted to furlough workers on Labor Day , Thanksgiving Day and the day after Thanksgiving rather than giving them paid time off work on those days . The change was proposed to help offset millions of dollars in revenue losses resulting from the COVID-19 crisis . It could save the county up to $ 1.8 million , officials said . But board members and administrators do n't know how many employees actually are affected by the decision because it does n't necessarily apply to unionized workers , whose pay and holidays are guaranteed by collective labor contracts . That uncertainty -- and the potential inequality -- drew criticism from many board members during Tuesday 's meeting , which has held remotely because of the pandemic . `` If this was across the board , I would n't have a problem with it , '' Antioch Republican Linda Pedersen said before she voted against the plan . `` This is only going to hurt some people , '' Gurnee-area Republican Steve Carlson said . `` This thing is not fair . '' Vernon Hills Democrat Julie Simpson acknowledged the plan was n't fair but voted for it anyway , saying `` we 're doing the best we can with what 's in our authority . '' The three days were chosen because they 're the last three paid holidays of the 2020 fiscal year , which ends Nov. 30 . The plan only applies to those days this fiscal year . Employees who have to work on any of those three days despite the furlough order will be paid at their regular rates rather than bonus rates for working on a holiday , County Administrator Gary Gibson said . Departments unable to enact the furloughs will have to make other spending cuts . To counter lost revenue from taxes and fees resulting from the pandemic , county officials have made about $ 18.5 million in operational cuts this year , said board member Paul Frank , who leads the panel 's financial and administrative committee . With the virus still raging and the economy not recovering , more cuts are needed , he said . Taking the money out of reserves is n't a prudent option because it could hurt the county 's bond rating and result in higher interest rates if the board needs to borrow money , Frank said . `` We have very few levers that we can pull that do n't hurt our people , '' Frank said . The financial savings from the furlough days could save 20 or 30 jobs , he said . `` This is a time when we require shared sacrifice , '' Frank added . Only some county worker unions have agreed to implement the furlough days , Frank said . The proposal passed in an 11-10 vote that mostly fell along party lines . Only Waukegan Democrat Diane Hewitt broke ranks , voting with the board 's nine Republicans against the plan . Three attempts to amend the proposal in different ways failed with identical vote counts . Because county board members ' salaries are not affected by the pay cut , Frank said he 'll donate a percentage of his salary to a local charity so he 's not exempt from the cut . Lake Zurich Republican Craig Taylor suggested all board members consider making similar donations so they `` get some skin in the game .

On the Mac , Big Sur -LRB- as the OS is called -RRB- has a ton of visual differences that I think will grow on you -- they make macOS look just a little more like iOS . It also does a weird new thing with links -- which also makes the Mac feel just a little more like iOS , too . The link behavior popped up on Twitter yesterday : if you 're an Apple News Plus subscriber , clicking links to publications that are part of that subscription bundle will take you to the Apple News app instead of your browser . iOS 14 will do the same thing . If you 're paying for Apple News Plus , this may be exactly what you want to happen . Instead of opening a page with a paywall , you just get the article you clicked on . Yes , the Apple News app itself is about as capable as Internet Explorer 3 compared to your browser with its tabs and such , but at least you do n't have to go though a copy and paste dance . You are reading Processor , a newsletter about computers , software , and tech by Dieter Bohn . Dieter writes about consumer tech , software , and the most important tech news of the day from The Verge . This newsletter delivers `` a few times per week , '' and many of them include longer columns . You can subscribe to Processor and learn more about it here . Processor is also a YouTube series with the same goal : providing smart and surprising analysis with a bit of humor . Subscribe to all of The Verge 's great videos here ! I do find the behavior a little weird . If you click a link in Safari , it opens Apple News . If you click a link in Chrome , it stays in Chrome . If you click a link in some other app like Slack , it opens in Apple News -- even if your default browser is Chrome . That 's odd simply because it 's not clear how Big Sur knows that it should redirect some websites but not others . Is it checking in with a pre-approved list of participating publisher sites -LRB- if so , at least it 's offline -RRB- ? Is that list stored locally or is it checking in with Apple ? Whatever the answer , the point is that what happens when you click a link is inconsistent . Maybe it opens a browser , maybe it opens Apple News . Apple is allowing you to uncheck an option for this in the preferences for the Apple News app , at least . Apple also sent this statement to me : Apple is committed to creating the best experience for Apple News + subscribers . This change offers subscribers seamless access to the content that is part of their News + subscription right in the News app or publisher app , as well as providing publishers with increased engagement and revenue opportunities on Apple News . News + subscribers can set their link preference in their News settings . I followed up with Apple to ask how Big Sur knows which links should go where and Apple declined to comment . Tony Haile is the person who brought all this up on Twitter , and he further pointed out that it means that publishers who do offer a direct subscription option will lose out on that chance with people going directly to Apple News , which pays much less . Haile , you should know , is the CEO of a company called Scroll that competes with Apple News in setting up partnerships with publishers . -LRB- I 've written about it before , here . -RRB- So he is n't an impartial observer . And as long as I 'm disclosing , Vox Media has partnerships with both Apple News and Scroll . That 's the thing about the decline of the web : suddenly it 's a lot harder to ignore the transactions that happen when you click a link . Anyway , there are much larger storylines you could plug this weird new link behavior into . There 's the fear that Apple is beginning to compromise user experience in the name of its services revenue . There 's the storyline that Apple actively distrusts the web and would like more activity to happen inside apps than inside browsers . If browsers are used less , that means fewer intrusive ads -LRB- win -RRB- , less tracking -LRB- win -RRB- , and less money for competitors like Google -LRB- triple bonus ! -RRB- . I am not hunting for a conspiracy here , though . Sometimes a company 's incentives line up with its values . I think it 's also fair to just read it as Apple finding that its users are hitting paywalls when they do n't need to because they 're already paying for Apple News Plus . Now to me , clicking on a link with `` http '' in front of it should take you to a web browser , but that 's just what I 'm used to . Nobody said links are the exclusive domain of the web . My overall vibe on seeing this behavior in Big Sur was a big ... sure , whatever . But to bring it all the way back around : preferencing Apple News over the otherwise normal behavior for links makes the Mac work just a little more like the iPhone , where until iOS 14 Apple rigidly controlled the default apps for everything . Even in iOS 14 , only the email and browser apps can be changed . The same `` values and incentives '' thing is coming for in-app ads on iOS 14 . Third-party apps will need to ask users for permission to track on an app-by-app basis -- but Apple 's own ad network apparently has a default opt-in for `` Personalized Ads . '' Apple legitimately is a thousand percent less creepy than the rest of the app ad ecosystem , but that does n't mean Apple itself wo n't benefit . It 's both . While we are on the subject of iOS , it 's been at the center of another controversy . Apple has reasserted that cloud gaming services like xCloud and Stadia violate App Store guidelines . It provided a repeat of a statement it had given Mark Gurman this past March , saying that `` gaming services can absolutely launch on the App Store as long as they follow the same set of guidelines applicable to all developers , including submitting games individually for review , and appearing in charts and search . '' Microsoft and Facebook issued fiery counter-statements , but I expect Apple will stand firm . It values reviewing apps for content and security too much and its Apple Arcade incentives happen to align with those values . Of course , I could be wrong : this could all just be a bunch of negotiation posturing as it was with Amazon . Bottom line : Apple wo n't allow Stadia or xCloud on the iPhone or iPad anytime soon . I 've made it this far without using the obvious cliché : `` walled garden . '' There it is , though . The thing about clichés is that they come from somewhere . It 's a good reminder that even hackneyed phrases can still have explanatory power . Walls are only there because people built them -- I just wish they 'd put more effort into building some doors , too . Reviews and first looks ┏ Acer Chromebook Spin 713 : the Chromebook to buy . If I were buying a Chromebook today , I 'd follow Monica Chin 's advice and get this one . Acer continues to just dominate Chromebooks . If you 're deciding between the Spin 713 and the $ 1,000 Galaxy Chromebook or the $ 849 i5 model of the Pixelbook Go , I would say you need a pretty good reason not to choose the Spin . ┏ Samsung Galaxy Buds Live review : cool beans . Chris Welch : To be very clear , these earbuds let in a significant amount of outside noise at all times . That 's intentional and where I think the `` Live '' part of the name comes from . These are n't going to drown out your co-workers when we get back to the office someday , nor are they going to be your preferred airplane companions . Samsung says it designed the Buds Live to eliminate very low frequencies -- think the persistent hum of an air conditioner or the rumbling of an Amtrak -- and you can hear some of that ambient sound get sliced off when you turn on active noise cancellation . ┏ Sony WH-1000XM4 review : the best noise-canceling headphones get better . Chris Welch had a double feature on headphone reviews : But to fend off its rivals , Sony has returned with the new $ 349.99 1000XM4 headphones , available for preorder today and shipping later this month . They address the two main downsides of the previous product : you can now pair to two devices simultaneously , and updated mics should make for clearer calls . ┏ The best part of the Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 Plus is its screen . Dan Seifert on the best thing about this tablet -LRB- the worst thing , of course , is that Android is not good on tablets -RRB- : Unsurprisingly , the absolute best thing by far about the Tab S7 Plus is its display . This 12.4-inch OLED panel is bright , vibrant , and pixel-dense . Colors practically jump off the screen , and the blacks are as inky and deep as they are on the LG OLED TV hanging in my living room . Topping it off is the 120Hz refresh rate , which makes every interaction buttery smooth . Yes , the iPad Pro has had this feature for three years , but it 's just as much of a delight here as it is on Apple 's tablet . In fact , given that this is an OLED panel , I might even argue that this is the nicest screen I 've ever seen on a mobile device . ┏ The new 27-inch iMac 's webcam is n't just better ; it 's smarter . And here 's my look at the new 2020 iMac . Tech News ┏ Toshiba is officially out of the laptop business . RIP . ┏ Microsoft 's new Xbox Series S console confirmed in leaked controller packaging . ┏ E Ink demos a folding e-reader that can also take notes . I 've seen a lot of prototypes from E Ink , which is the company that officially makes screens that are proper E Ink and not just `` e-paper '' or whatever . Also an inside baseball note : if you are a tech blogger and mess any of the above up , E Ink will definitely be letting you know . The company 's whole bag is to promote E Ink , after all . ANYWAY ! I would love to see something like this in a smaller form factor . There 's something I love about holding a book open at an angle ; it 's a scratch that regular e-readers do n't itch . ┏ Google Maps finally works with CarPlay 's excellent dashboard mode . ┏ Google has already discontinued the Pixel 4 and 4 XL . ┏ Google 's Pixel 5 and Pixel 4A 5G could be available to preorder on October 8th . ┏ Microsoft signals renewed interest in Windows with latest reshuffle . Tom Warren : Now , Microsoft is moving parts of Windows development back under Panos Panay 's control . Specifically , that means the Windows fundamentals and developer experience teams have been returned to what we traditionally call the Windows team . It 's an admission that the big Windows split did n't work quite as planned . We 've seen plenty of evidence of that with a messy development experience for Windows 10 , delayed Windows updates , a lack of major new features , and lots of Windows update issues recently . TikTok and China ┏ The US declared war on TikTok because it ca n't handle the truth . Sarah Jeong zooms out from the back and forth news stories to talk about the larger context . Must read : I call this ideology information-nationalism . Here 's how I would describe its assumptions : 1 . When your country acknowledges human rights abuses , you are made weak 2 . You can weaken rival nation-states by exposing their human rights abuses ┏ The big legal questions behind Trump 's TikTok and WeChat bans . Adi Robertson : There 's at least one major wrinkle in both cases : while sanctions are nothing new , the ByteDance and Tencent orders ban Americans from accessing a piece of software and -LRB- at least in theory -RRB- the content on its network . This is unusual and could raise First Amendment questions that do n't apply in other IEEPA cases -- including arguments that apps like TikTok are protected speech , or that banning them would infringe on users ' ability to engage in it . ┏ Bill Gates calls Microsoft 's TikTok deal a poisoned chalice . ┏ How Trump 's WeChat ban could devastate Apple 's Chinese business . Chaim Gartenberg : An iPhone without WeChat is effectively not a phone at all for the hundreds of millions of Chinese users that rely on the service -- customers on which Apple 's entire iPhone business model relies . If Apple ca n't offer WeChat on the iPhone due to Trump 's ban , then much of its Chinese business will almost certainly evaporate overnight . ┏ Huawei says it 's running out of chips for its smartphones because of US sanctions . Kim Lyons : -LSB- Trump 's order -RSB- prevented foreign manufacturers of semiconductors who use American software and technology in their operations from shipping their products to Huawei unless they first obtained a license from the US . Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. -LRB- TSMC -RRB- , the largest semiconductor manufacturer in the world , reportedly halted orders for Huawei 's HiSilicon unit in May following the new US rule . ┏ Scientists rename human genes to stop Microsoft Excel from misreading them as dates . Incredible story by James Vincent : There are tens of thousands of genes in the human genome : minuscule twists of DNA and RNA that combine to express all of the traits and characteristics that make each of us unique . Each gene is given a name and alphanumeric code , known as a symbol , which scientists use to coordinate research . But over the past year or so , some 27 human genes have been renamed , all because Microsoft Excel kept misreading their symbols as dates . ┏ Computer scientist Frances Allen , known for her work on compiling , dies at 88 . Kim Lyons : Allen helped build an experimental compiler for IBM 's Advanced Computing system , and from 1980 to the mid-1990s , she headed a research team at IBM working on the new concept of parallel computing , which became widely used in personal computers . She also helped develop software for IBM 's Blue Gene supercomputer project . ┏ The Galaxy Z Fold 2 is Samsung 's big promise that it can fix its foldable future . Chaim Gartenberg : It 's a message focused on selling customers a phone based on the things that it is n't -- too small , too awkward , too prone to breaking -- rather than the things that it is . It also puts a lot of pressure on the upcoming Z Fold 2 . ┏ Microsoft and Samsung need each other now more than ever . Jon Porter : It 's not a new partnership , and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella even personally appeared at Samsung 's Note 10 event last year . But it 's more important than ever before , as the industry hurtles toward the next big ecosystem battle between iOS and Android . It 's no longer just about the phones themselves but about how these phones interact with the other computers in your life , whether they 're laptops , desktops , or even game consoles . And Samsung 's deepening partnership with Microsoft is essential to its approach .

In new interviews following WWDC , Apple VP of technologies Kevin Lynch offered more details on the strategy behind the company 's implementation of sleep tracking with Apple Watch . Speaking to the Independent , Lynch explained that Apple spent `` a lot of time learning about the science of sleep '' before adding sleep tracking to Apple Watch . The goal of Apple 's implementation is simply to help people get to sleep and avoid distractions before bed : Lynch explains that the focus , `` Is really about getting enough sleep and the main thing about that is the difficulty of going to bed . There are so many things in the world to distract us and occupy our attention . Supporting people in managing that transition is where the magic is . '' One of the differentiators between Apple Watch 's native sleep tracking app and third-party apps is the amount of data presented to users . Many third-party apps offer details on things like deep sleep and sleep stages , but Apple 's app forgoes that strategy : `` In our testing , what we 've found is that it 's very difficult to understand what 's going on in your brain from a device that 's not reading the electrical signals of your brain , '' Lynch explains . `` In any of these adventures we go on when building things here we ask , what will make the most difference for people that , from a mainstream perspective , will be easy , helpful and empowering . '' In a separate interview with CNET , Lynch elaborated a bit more on the testing Apple did before concluding that the duration is the most important sleep data point to track : `` Even in our studies , we had people wear EEGs on their heads , so we got insight into the electrical activity of their brain , in addition to what we 're able to sense on the wrist with Apple Watch , '' Lynch says . `` And we 've learned a lot about how the main thing here is really about duration . '' Lynch also said that Apple wants to avoid causing people anxiety about the amount of sleep they get but rather providing recognition when the goals are achieved : `` There could be anxiety that people have about going to sleep , and that anxiety itself can actually cause more problems in terms of going to sleep , '' Lynch says . `` Many people are already well aware that they have n't been getting enough sleep , and so we 're not adding to that , but we are positively acknowledging when you have achieved your goals . '' And of course , Lynch emphasized that privacy is at the forefront of Apple 's implementation of sleep tracking -- unlike some of the competition . Companies like Fitbit have used anonymized user data for years to study demographic sleep patterns and improve observations on sleep , but Apple does n't plan to do that . Instead , Apple has been building its machine learning models from data collected through internal studies . `` And that takes a long time . So we 've been working on this for a while , '' Lynch says . `` We treat the data that 's being collected on a user 's device with a high level of sensitivity around privacy . ... Apple is not seeing your sleep data . '' To learn more about Apple Watch sleep tracking with watchOS 7 , check out our full hands-on walkthrough .

'' Ex-Pimco honcho Douglas Hodge -- who paid more than $ 850,000 in bribes to get his kids into elite universities -- is demanding to be allowed to serve the remainder of his 9-month sentence at home , the Boston Herald reported . In his bid for `` compassionate release , '' Hodge , 62 , argues that being locked up amid the pandemic is `` torture under United Nations guidelines , '' according to according to court documents cited by the paper . Hodge checked into federal prison in Otisville on June 23 -- and claims he was forced to suffer through 29 days of solitary quarantine , according to the report . He claims his sentence should either be reduced , or that he should be allowed to do time at his personal pad . `` The government essentially argues that Mr. Hodge deserves this harsh sentence and the consequences for his family because he is unrepentant . The government is wrong ; Mr. Hodge has taken complete and sole responsibility for his conduct . The government 's arguments to the contrary are misconceived , '' his lawyers say in the appeals documents . But federal prosecutors say prisoners at the medium-security lockup where Hodge is incarcerated -- which up until recently housed President Trump 's former attorney Michael Cohen -- are treated humanely . They say conditions are sanitary , and that prisoners are permitted to shower three times a week . `` They are also permitted to get fresh clothing , fill water jugs , and get ice '' and have access to books , TV , papers , mail and the commissary , the feds responded . `` Hodge 's hyperbolic claim that his initial quarantine period was 29 days of ` sensory isolation ' amounting to torture under United Nation standards is false . '' The solitary quarantine was taken to `` minimize risk '' of COVID-19 , and was n't punishment , they added . `` Hodge has sought to evade the consequences of his crimes at every turn . '' The request for compassionate release comes as the coronavirus crisis has forced US prisons to clamp down on outbreaks , and as other well-heeled parents involved in the college admissions have been allowed to delay trials until February . Later this month , a federal judge in Boston will also rule on whether to accept a plea deal from disgraced actress Lori Loughlin and her husband Husband Mossimo Giannulli .", "seg_content_paragraph_starts": "0 37 79 120 173 232 281 347 384 423", "simhash": "b4346167e0bb7a10de948086ec156209", "spacy_content_loc": ["New York", "Otisville", "US", "Boston"], "spacy_content_num": ["more than $ 850,000", "three"], "spacy_content_org": ["Ex-Pimco", "the Boston Herald", "Hodge", "United Nations", "Hodge", "Hodge", "Hodge", "United Nation", "Hodge"], "spacy_content_otr": [], "spacy_content_per": ["Douglas Hodge", "Hodge", "Hodge", "Trump", "Michael Cohen", "Lori Loughlin", "Mossimo Giannulli"], "spacy_content_tim": ["62", "June 23", "29 days", "29 days", "February", "Later this month"], "spacy_title_loc": ["upstate"], "spacy_title_num": [], "spacy_title_org": [], "spacy_title_otr": [], "spacy_title_per": [], "spacy_title_tim": [], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"CrimePublicsafety": 0.9978009462356567}, "second_cat": {"CrimePublicsafety_Other": 0.9978009462356567}}, "title_c_count": 14, "tpc_m": {"t540": 0.3742493689060211, "t921": 0.16866467893123627, "t808": 0.12385350465774536}, "url": "https://nypost.com/2020/08/09/college-admissions-scandal-ceo-whines-upstate-prison-is-torture/"}	{"_id": "0PTKkJnQ", "c_word": 1016, "channels": ["Federal^^Prison", "State^^Prison", "Sentencing", "Federal^^Indictment", "Federal^^Court"], "countries": "us", "date": "2020-06-29 21:11:00", "domain": "nola.com", "epoch": {"$numberLong": "1593465060"}, "geotag": [{"name": "new orleans", "score": 0.9802754521369934, "coord": "29.951066,-90.071532", "pid": "new_orleans,louisiana", "type": "city"}, {"name": "Louisiana", "score": 1.0, "pid": "louisiana", "type": "state"}], "highlightkeyword_list": [["Michael^^Arata", 0.9555645271471478], ["Peter^^Hoffman", 0.2159792000396008], ["Susan^^Hoffman", 0.0399156009844854], ["Esplanade^^Avenue", 0.002333536688730688], ["Martin^^Feldman", 0.0021857303609705285], ["Mardi^^Gras", 0.0019191177730667364], ["Moon^^Landrieu", 0.0015438735394601828], ["Mitch^^Landrieu", 0.00136273314391388], ["Gregg^^Costa", 0.001314501360023206], ["Billy^^Gibbens", 0.0011247717878906582], ["Pensacola", 7.0966366771422E-6], ["film", 1.0547751631655298E-6], ["Hollywood", 8.340150026333351E-7], ["FBI", 8.267609182150159E-7], ["Louisiana", 7.971773658514296E-7]], "kw_title": ["Judge^^James^^Dennis", "Louisiana"], "kws": ["Federal^^sentencing^^guidelines", "federal^^indictment", "sentencing^^guidelines", "court", "convictions", "probation^^officers", "Judge^^James^^Dennis", "Louisiana", "Arata^^probation", "numerous^^charges", "prison^^scrubs", "tax^^credits", "low-ball^^sentences", "Susan^^Hoffman", "FBI", "bars", "men", "Peter^^Hoffman", "mild^^penalty", "Martin^^Feldman"], "ne_content_location": {"Esplanade Avenue": 1, "Pensacola": 2, "Hollywood": 1, "New Orleans": 3, "U.S.": 1}, "ne_content_organization": {"Congress": 1, "FBI": 1, "Sentencing Commission": 1}, "ne_content_person": {"Ronald Reagan": 1, "Hoffman": 3, "Blake": 1, "Peter Hoffman": 4, "Moon Landrieu": 1, "James Dennis": 1, "Dennis": 1, "Martin Feldman": 1, "Feldman": 14, "Billy Gibbens": 1, "Bill Clinton": 1, "Carolyn Dineen King": 1, "Susan Hoffman": 2, "Barack Obama": 1, "Costa": 2, "Mardi Gras": 1, "Emily": 1, "Michael Arata": 1, "Gregg Costa": 1, "Arata": 17, "Jimmy Carter": 1, "Mitch Landrieu": 1}, "ne_title_location": {"Louisiana": 1}, "ne_title_organization": {}, "ne_title_person": {}, "paragraph_count": 22.0, "predicate_content": ["working", "been", "been", "measured", "restored", "took", "was", "gave", "returned", "agreed", "came", "sought", "fare", "gave", "called", "declined", "caused", "managed", "was", "took", "showed", "described", "were", "questioned", "noted", "buy", "put", "wrote", "'s", "added", "chided", "noted", "means"], "predicate_title": ["doubles"], "seg_content": "His Fourth of July weekend working on a house in Pensacola figures to be the most relaxing in years for New Orleans attorney Michael Arata , with prison no longer on the horizon . It 's been six years since Arata , Hollywood producer Peter Hoffman and his wife , Susan Hoffman , fell under a 25-count federal indictment that accused them of bilking a state tax credit program that subsidized film industry infrastructure to the tune of more than $ 1 million . It 's been three years since a federal jury convicted all three of them . A federal appeals court had all but measured up Peter Hoffman and Arata for prison scrubs in 2018 , when it threw out an unusual decision by U.S. District Judge Martin Feldman to hand each of them probation -- despite sentencing guidelines that recommended years in prison for each of them . The court also restored numerous charges that Feldman had tossed , rejecting the jury 's verdicts on those counts . Less than a week before Mardi Gras , Feldman took another swing at leveling a punishment that would pass muster . The second round was n't a lot stiffer than the first . He again gave Arata probation , though this time he said that the lawyer would have to serve an additional year of probation confined to his home . A month later , as New Orleans weathered the early throes of the coronavirus pandemic , prosecutors returned to court on March 19 , this time to strike a deal with Arata that ended the case against him . The government agreed to Feldman 's probation term for Arata , in exchange for Arata accepting his conviction . Even that mild penalty came with some wiggle room , though . Last week , Arata sought and received permission from Feldman to travel to Pensacola during his home confinement through July 3 , `` and thereafter as necessary , '' as long as Arata notifies probation officers . Hoffman did n't fare quite as well as Arata . But Feldman gave him a revised sentence of just 20 months in prison , which the producer is still fighting . Federal sentencing guidelines had called for Arata to serve between 9 and 11 years behind bars . His attorney , Billy Gibbens , declined to comment on the deal . The leniency Feldman has shown Arata , who comes from a local family prominent in local politics and the law , has caused some buzz in New Orleans legal circles . Arata 's late father , Blake , managed Moon Landrieu 's winning 1970 mayoral campaign and then served as his city attorney . Arata 's wife , Emily , was for years a top aide to Lt. Gov. and then Mayor Mitch Landrieu . A nominee of President Ronald Reagan , Feldman took a deeply jaundiced view of the government 's case throughout the prolonged prosecution . It showed both times he sentenced the two men , who along with Susan Hoffman had been accused of conspiring to steal more than $ 1 million in tax credits by inflating the costs for the conversion of a moribund Esplanade Avenue mansion into a post-production film studio . In a 124-page denunciation of the government 's attack , Feldman described `` unchecked prosecutorial zeal '' and accused prosecutors of employing `` mean-spirited hype '' to convict them . The rules surrounding the state 's film tax credit program were `` at best gray '' when the renovation began , he wrote , and the law spelling out the incentives was `` implemented haphazardly and in a manner rife with disorder . '' Though he upheld the jury 's convictions of all three defendants on the conspiracy charge , among others , Feldman questioned whether the state had actually lost any money from the scheme , given that work on the project had eventually gotten done . He noted that the studio `` ultimately earned at least the amount in tax credits that it received . '' But the appeals court did n't buy his reasoning , restoring convictions on all five counts that Feldman had thrown out against Peter Hoffman , and nine of the 11 counts he 'd tossed against Arata . The panel 's 2-1 majority was particularly put out by the probation sentence that Feldman handed to Peter Hoffman , whose guidelines called for him to serve at least 14 years . `` Giving probation to the leader of a sophisticated , multimillion-dollar fraud scheme ... perpetuates one of the problems Congress sought to eliminate '' when it created a Sentencing Commission , wrote appeals court Judge Gregg Costa , a nominee of President Barack Obama . While judges have discretion , it 's not absolute , and Costa slammed Feldman for going `` from roughly 15 years in prison to zero , '' calling it a `` colossal '' gap and `` a variance too far . '' Costa added that Hoffman `` would have stolen millions from the state if it had not detected his scheme . '' The appeals court chided Feldman less over Arata 's sentence . It noted that its decision to reinstate charges against Arata could have a greater effect on his recommended prison term . `` For at least one thing , our reversal of some of the false statement counts means that Arata lied to the FBI in connection with the investigation , '' Costa noted . Judge Carolyn Dineen King , a nominee of President Jimmy Carter , joined Costa for the majority . Judge James Dennis , a nominee of President Bill Clinton , dissented from the decision to upend Hoffman 's sentence . Dennis argued that deference to judges should be equally respected with regard to low-ball sentences as to high ones , which courts rarely overturn . In response to the appeals court , Feldman added a year to Arata 's probation , from four to five years , records show .", "seg_content_paragraph_starts": "0 34 99 171 232 290 339 370 400 475 547 577 621 685 722 754 799 862 894 927 945 991", "simhash": "9f60ab6a6b8c1a3a975cf392e9f555b9", "spacy_content_loc": ["Pensacola", "New Orleans", "Hollywood", "U.S.", "New Orleans", "Pensacola", "New Orleans", "Esplanade Avenue", "Costa"], "spacy_content_num": ["more than $ 1 million", "three", "second", "first", "two", "more than $ 1 million", "three", "five", "nine", "11", "2", "multimillion-dollar", "one", "zero", "millions", "at least one"], "spacy_content_org": ["Mardi Gras", "Congress", "a Sentencing Commission", "Arata", "FBI"], "spacy_content_otr": [], "spacy_content_per": ["Michael Arata", "Arata", "Peter Hoffman", "Susan Hoffman", "Peter Hoffman", "Arata", "Martin Feldman", "Feldman", "Feldman", "Arata", "Arata", "Feldman", "Arata", "Arata", "Arata", "Feldman", "Arata", "Hoffman", "Arata", "Feldman", "Arata", "Billy Gibbens", "Feldman", "Arata", "Arata", "Blake", "Moon Landrieu 's", "Arata", "Emily", "Mitch Landrieu", "Ronald Reagan", "Feldman", "Susan Hoffman", "Feldman", "Feldman", "Feldman", "Peter Hoffman", "Arata", "Feldman", "Peter Hoffman", "Gregg Costa", "Barack Obama", "Feldman", "Costa", "Hoffman", "Feldman", "Arata", "Arata"], "spacy_content_tim": ["Fourth of July weekend", "years", "six years", "three years", "2018", "years", "Less than a week", "an additional year", "A month later", "March 19", "Last week", "July 3", "just 20 months", "between 9 and 11 years", "1970", "years", "at least 14 years", "roughly 15 years"], "spacy_title_loc": [], "spacy_title_num": [], "spacy_title_org": ["Louisiana"], "spacy_title_otr": [], "spacy_title_per": [], "spacy_title_tim": [], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"CrimePublicsafety": 0.9848306775093079}, "second_cat": {"CrimePublicsafety_Other": 0.9848306775093079}}, "title_c_count": 17, "tpc_m": {"t423": 0.14530111849308014, "t461": 0.16578398644924164, "t882": 0.12338311225175858}, "url": "https://www.nola.com/news/courts/article_e4847a04-ba3a-11ea-91cd-4357d181ca6d.html"}

The increase in July bills reflects both the volumic price of wastewater generation -LRB- up 42 percent -RRB- , and debt service for capital improvements -LRB- up 20 percent -RRB- . `` That is a substantial rate increase , which is n't what Rockport has generally done , '' said Rick Knowlton , president of the Scarborough-based Maine Water , in a phone conversation Aug 3 . In July 2020 , Rockport wastewater users were bill at $ 13.50 per 100 cubic feet of sewage , in July 2021 , that rose to $ 19.25 for the same amount of sewage . One homeowner opened a $ 1,600 quarterly water and wastewater bill July 29 . Another received a $ 700 bill for the last quarter , when a year ago it was $ 300 for the same time period . Still another received a $ 425 quarterly sewer bill when the total had previously been $ 225 . `` It is our hope that we will be able to reduce sewer rates in the coming year , hopefully by then we will have been able to determine where the inflow problem is and it will be corrected , we also ask that all homeowners and businesses do what they can to resolve this issue , '' said Brackett . `` If you know you have a roof drain or sump pump , or other items connected to the system that should not be there , please remove it and find another way to discharge the water . '' See below for her complete memo -LRB- also included in the attached Select Board packet -RRB- . There are approximately 641 residential and commercial customers of the wastewater system , and use Maine Water as their water source . The rest of Rockport residents have their own septic and well systems . Town Manager Post is offering the Select Board/Wastewater Commissioners mitigation proposals , including reducing , `` the usage rate from $ 19.25 per unit to $ 18.10 per unit . This would make a difference for an average single-family user of about $ 8.05 per quarter or $ 32.20 for the year . '' His proposals follow : `` Proposed Changes to the Budget `` Debt Service Fee Related Changes `` 1 . There is a line in the Capital Improvement Plan for the lease payment of another vehicle for wastewater , as we now have two people contracted to maintain our system , and currently only have one vehicle . This could be removed for this year as Woodward and Curran will need to hire another person , as one of the two we have has moved onto another job . The total of this would be $ 16,000 . `` 2 . We could reduce the reserve deposit for the Camden Treatment Plant upgrades to $ 62,000 from $ 72,000 , this would be a savings of $ 10,000 . This $ 10,000 savings however would need to be made up in the coming year . We have been told that Camden plans to bid out the treatment plant project this fall with work to start next year . `` With these two suggested changes , and keeping the use of the Capital Reserve at $ 104,000 , we could reduce the debt service fee from $ 74.03 to $ 68.58 , which would be a decrease of $ 5.45 per equivalent user per quarter , or a yearly total of $ 21.80 . `` Usage Rate Related Changes `` 1 . We can remove the monthly billing from the Administration budget and go back to quarterly billing . Maine Water is not currently prepared to accommodate monthly billing . This would be a reduction of $ 17,000 . `` 2 . We can reduce the Camden Treatment Plant billing amount . We currently have $ 353,272 in this line . Over the past five quarters we have sent Camden an average of 10,612 units of wastewater to be treated per quarter . This would mean that on average we would send them 42,448 units of wastewater in course of the year . At Camden 's current usage rate of $ 7.46 per unit , that would equate to $ 316,662.08 in the fiscal year . I would recommend that this budget amount could be reduced to $ 325,000 , a savings of $ 28,272 . I would not recommend going less then this as usage overall is higher for the first quarter of this year because of people being home more . `` 3 . We do not have new rates from Rockland yet , but last year we spent $ 148,205.45 to treat what we sent to them . Figuring a 10 % increase between usage and rate adjustments , that would mean we would spend about $ 163,025.99 . We currently have budgeted $ 163,461 . `` With the changes I have outlined above , we could reduce the usage rate from $ 19.25 per unit to $ 18.10 per unit . This would make a difference for an average single-family user of about $ 8.05 per quarter or $ 32.20 for the year . `` The changes proposed between the debt service fee and the usage charges would have a combined quarterly savings of $ 13.50 , for a single user family , and a yearly savings of $ 54.00 over the current rates . '' `` Other Items to Consider `` 1 . As a result of COIV-19 Maine Water did not read actual meters in April to determine that quarters usage . Instead they came up with an average usage amount and billed users that amount , about one third of our users saw no change at all ; I can correlate those users to ones that either have digital meters or they are not connected to public water so their bills are estimated anyway and they are charged the same amount each quarter . `` One third of the users had over estimations for the April billing , which means they were billed for more than they actually used . The other third of users are the ones that saw huge increases in their July bill . I do believe that it would be fair to bill those users that were under charged in April at the prior rate of $ 13.50 . My recommendation would be to do this for all accounts that were underestimated in the month of April . This would be a total cost savings for those accounts of $ 12,652.88 . '' Reasons for increase are across the board According to Brackett , the reasons for Rockport 's increase in both debt service -LRB- for capital improvements to the wastewater system -RRB- and usage fees are many and varied . Rockport is anticipating a rate hike from Rockland -LRB- which takes waste from the Glen Cove and Samoset condominiums -RRB- and Camden , for its major wastewater treatment facility overhaul . Brackett all cited increasing nonpayment of sewer system bills . `` We are processing more lines for nonpayment of sewer bills , '' she wrote in her memo -LRB- see below -RRB- . `` This means that we have more residents that are not paying their sewer bills and our only recourse is to start the lien process on those accounts that are more than 90 days past due . '' The usage rate of each wastewater customer , as Brackett explained , goes like this : Users receive quarterly sewer bills from Maine Water , and the sewer usage is based on the amount of water that is brought into a home . Maine Water meters the water intake , `` and we assume what goes in must come out , which is the standard practice , '' she wrote . `` If you live in a house that is not connected to public water , then Maine Water has a way to estimate your usage based on the number of people living in the house and the size of the house . Once your usage has been determined then we apply the usage rate to that amount . For example , say your normal usage is 14 units a quarter , this would equate to a charge of $ 269.50 for the quarter -LRB- 14 units multiplied by the usage rate of $ 19.25 per unit -RRB- , or $ 89.83 a month . '' Maine Water has recorded an increase of water usage since April , attributes the increase to its own set of assessments . Some of it is irrigation , because of drought conditions and a warm summer , the company has said . Water customers do have control over monitoring their personal irrigation usage by installing submeters to their household monitoring system . Those meters are installed by plumbers at the homeowner 's expense , and then it is the homeowner 's responsibility to track the irrigation meter usage , which is then submitted to Maine Water . The customer installing the submeter must let Scott Bickford , Rockport 's code enforcement officer , know about the installation in order to get it inspected . The two big drivers in the wastewater bill increase , said Rick Knowlton , Maine Water president , include Rockport 's substantial rate increase as of July 1 , as well as the effects of a warm summer . `` We 've seen residential water usage go up across the state , '' said Knowlton . He cited a 16 percent increase in water usage amongst Maine Water customers across Maine . Maine Water serves 32,000 customers in southern and Midcoast Maine , and inland to Fryeburg and Skowhegan . And while residential water use increased during the months of the pandemic , when people were sequestered at home , the non-residential use , `` is way down , '' he said . While customers were billed at the new rate , they also had used more water , said Knowlton . There are , according to Maine Water , two dozen customers who water usage is up considerably more than the same quarter last year . Knowlton attributed that to more lawn watering , and new swimming pools and hot tubs . `` People have been creating ways to enjoy their homes than in the past , '' he said . Pam Blackman , Maine Water Customer Service Manager , who oversees the Maine Water call center that receives the complaints about billing , added sprinklers , leaking toilets , and more home water usage , in general , with the pandemic . Blackman said she was in close contact with Brackett over the past weeks to determine which customer bills required Maine Water investigation into questionable over-usage of water . There were , said Blackman , eight customers in the Rockport wastewater billing system , that required a closer look at water consumption . `` She -LSB- Brackett -RSB- gave me a list of customers to review , '' said Blackman . Typically , a home uses 100 to 150 gallons a day of water , said Knowlton . A leaking toilet alone can draw 1,000 gallons a day , he said . Wastewater Update By Megan Brackett , Finance Director As most are now aware , we have uncovered some possible billing errors with wastewater for the 2nd quarter of 2020 . We are working diligently with customers and Maine Water to determine what the issues are and are examining each account . Meanwhile , there are some key points that I would like to discuss so that there is a better understanding of the wastewater system , how our rates are established , and how the billing cycle works . The History of the System In the 1980 's , the Town of Rockport addressed a serious environmental issue . Many homes and businesses were discharging their sewage directly into the Penobscot Bay , both into Rockport Harbor and Clam Cove . Under State and Federal mandates , the Town constructed a wastewater collection system -LRB- the sewer -RRB- in two parts ; one to service Rockport Village and surrounding areas , and another to service the Glen Cove portion of Town . Agreements were secured with Camden -LRB- for the Village system -RRB- and Rockland -LRB- for the Glen Cove system -RRB- to send the collected wastewater to their treatment plants , which meant that Rockport did not have to construct its own treatment plant . The construction of the two separate systems was financed with a combination of State and Federal grants and by borrowing money through bonds that were to be paid back over several years by the users of the wastewater systems . Since the original construction of the system , we have increased the number of road miles that is serviced by the system . Extensions to the original system to serve Camden Hills Regional High School and properties along Commercial Street -LRB- Route 1 -RRB- from West St. -LRB- Route 90 -RRB- south to Elwood Avenue were constructed between 1988 and 1989 funded in part by a Tax Increment Financing District -LRB- TIF -RRB- established for that purpose . As the Comprehensive Plan was developed in 2003 - 2004 , the issue of expanding the wastewater system was addressed . One of the highest priorities noted in the Comprehensive Plan is the linking of the two wastewater systems by extending the sewer system along Commercial Street from Elwood Ave -LRB- the southern terminus of the `` Village '' system -RRB- to South Street -LRB- the northern terminus of the Glen Cove system -RRB- . In the summer of 2014 , the Wastewater Commissioners undertook engineering and feasibility studies for one section of this area , from Elwood Avenue to Sea Light Lane . In 2019 the voters of Rockport approved a 4.5 million-dollar bond that will be used to continue the system and finish the connection between the Southern and Northern ends . This extension is now known as the Sea Light Lane to South Street extension . Much of this project will be funded using TIF revenues and State and Federal grant money . Our current plan is to send this project out to bid this fall and start construction next spring . The additional construction that the Town undertook has two major components to it that benefit the Town as a whole . The first being that access to public sewer and public water have proven to increase development in the areas in which it is available , the more development we have in Town , the more value there is to spread the tax commitment to , thus potentially lowering your property tax bills . The second major component is that it allowed property owners of failing septic systems the option to discharge their waste by connecting to the public system and avoiding a huge expense on their part to construct a new septic system . How Rates are Established The Debt Service Fee - February of each year the Finance Director and Woodard and Curran Engineers and system maintenance crew meet and update the capital improvement plan for the system . The plan includes items ranging from pump replacements at our pump stations , to placing motorized cameras in the pipes to check for cracks or leaks , to replacing full pump stations . These are very important steps , as we want to make sure that we are maintaining the system the best way we can so that we do not end up with costly breakdowns or repairs . Once we have come up with a list of the things we would like to get done , this is condensed down to what we can afford to do , and what has to be done before we have issues with the system . We also know that the Camden Treatment Plant needs some very costly repairs and upgrades , and we are responsible for a portion of those upgrades . A few years ago , we established a reserve account and have been setting aside a portion of what we believe will be our annual debt payment to Camden for these upgrades . We did this to help lessen the burden on the sewer users in the future with a drastic increase in the debt service fee to cover the cost of this upgrade ; instead we have been able to save money for this purpose alone and increase the debt service fee slightly each year to cover this increase . Once we have finalized the capital improvement plan , we then determine what the debt service fee will be for the new year . The debt service fee is figured by looking at the total estimated cost of our above and below ground capital maintenance , add in any debt payments that have to be made that year , and subtract the budgeted use of the Capital Reserve . In the Fiscal Year 2020-2021 wastewater budget we have allocated $ 279,000 to above ground capital maintenance , $ 75,000 to below ground capital maintenance and an annual capital reserve deposit of $ 40,000 , for a total capital investment of $ 394,000 . We also budgeted using $ 104,000 from the Capital Reserve , making the net amount billed to users $ 290,000 . This $ 290,000 investment is then divided equally to all users of the system , and anyone that owns property where sewer is located but has not connected to the system . We also have $ 276,142 due in principal and interest payment on current debt that is due by the system , of this amount $ 212,591 is funded by TIF revenues , which leaves the net amount $ 63,551 . We currently have 1,194 equivalent users of the system , which means each equivalent user is being charged $ 296.11 per year or $ 74.03 per quarter . This is an increase of $ 12.24 per quarter over last year -LRB- ending June 30 , 2020 -RRB- . The Usage Rate -- The usage rate is comprised of all other operating expenses not listed above , including contracted services to maintain the system , treatment expenses from the Town of Camden and City of Rockland , administrative services for billing , record keeping and lien processing , as well as additional Town of Rockport staff time to conduct other wastewater related business . Your usage is directly correlated to how much water you bring into your house . We do not have separate meters for the outgoing wastewater , so we rely on Maine Water 's meters for the incoming water , which is the standard practice . If you do not have access to public water , but you use the public wastewater system , Maine Water will estimate your usage based on your house and family size and you are charged an estimated usage amount . If you have outside water faucets that you use a lot for watering , or filling your pool , you can purchase a meter to attach to that faucet and call in your meter readings to Maine Water for a credit on that usage , as that water is not returning to our wastewater system to be treated . If you are interested in this , you should reach out to Scott Bickford , Code Enforcement Officer at the Town Office . If you are not on Maine Water for public water , and connected to the public wastewater system , your current wastewater bills is estimated based on a formula in the sewer ordinance . Depending on your living situation , this might result in an overcharge of what you are using . The only way that we have to correct this and get a more accurate reading is for you to install a meter on your well , it would be the same type of meter discussed above . You be responsible for calling Maine Water with the actual readings from the meter , but you would only be charged for what you are sending through the system . If this is something that you are interested in , please reach out to Code Enforcement Officer Scott Bickford and he can help you with this process . Some major changes that effected this year 's usage rates are as follows : 1 . There is an inflow/infiltration problem somewhere in the system , this could be from users connecting sump pumps and/or roof drains to the system . This is a problem because this additional water is not metered , and we have no way of billing customers for this . Last summer the Town spent a significant amount of time and resources trying to locate the sources of additional inflow . We may also have a crack in an inground pipe that we are not aware of , which is why we are dedicating resources to sending motorized cameras through the pipes . We are certain this is a problem because we are being billed from Camden and Rockland for more waste then what we are billing . 2 . We are projecting increases from the City of Rockland and Town of Camden for the costs associated in treating Rockport 's Wastewater . It has been asked of us many times why our usage rate is not low like Camden 's ? This answer is twofold , one being that Camden is charging us the same usage rate as their customers are being charged , which is reasonable as it is costing them the same amount to treat Rockport 's waste as it is theirs ; and Camden has 1,880 users -LRB- not including the Town of Rockport users -RRB- and Rockport has 1,194 users . This means that there are more users to split the costs . On the other side , Rockland has 4,600 users on their system , a difference of 3,406 users . Another driving factor for keeping Camden usage rates low is that in the past , per Camden 's Town Charter , the entire tax base paid for sewer projects instead of just the users of the system . Camden has a minimum quarterly bill which is currently $ 74.60 a quarter . To put it into prospective , that is just slightly more than our current debt service payment . 3 . We are processing more lines for nonpayment of sewer bills . This means that we have more residents that are not paying their sewer bills and our only recourse is to start the lien process on those accounts that are more than 90 days past due . How the Billing Works Users receive quarterly sewer bills from Maine Water , and your sewer usage is based on the amount of water that is brought into your home . Maine Water has a meter on the incoming water , and we assume what goes in must come out , which is the standard practice . If you live in a house that is not connected to public water , then Maine Water has a way to estimate your usage based on the number of people living in the house and the size of the house . Once your usage has been determined then we apply the usage rate to that amount . For example , say your normal usage is 14 units a quarter , this would equate to a charge of $ 269.50 for the quarter -LRB- 14 units multiplied by the usage rate of $ 19.25 per unit -RRB- , or $ 89.83 a month . Also included in your quarterly bill is the debt service fee , this fee is based on how many equivalent user -LRB- s -RRB- you have assessed to your home or business . The number of equivalent users is determined by the Code Enforcement Officer when you get the permit to connect to the sewer system . The current rate is $ 74.03 per quarter per equivalent user . In Summary It is our hope that we will be able to reduce sewer rates in the coming year , hopefully by then we will have been able to determine where the inflow problem is and it will be corrected , we also ask that all homeowners and businesses do what they can to resolve this issue . If you know you have a roof drain or sump pump , or other items connected to the system that should not be there , please remove it and find another way to discharge the water . All wastewater items , including approving and adopting the annual wastewater budget are discussed at open Select Board Meetings -LRB- acting as Wastewater Commissioners -RRB- .

Voters in Eureka will be asked on the Aug. 4 primary ballot if the city should sell its system to Missouri American Water . The measure , which is called Proposition S , will require a simple majority to pass . Before the election , residents will have opportunities to view videos about the proposed sale and take part in virtual or in-person town hall meetings . The city of Eureka and Missouri American Water will host a virtual meeting at 7 p.m. Tuesday , June 30 . Missouri American Water spokeswoman Christine Page said the meeting will be broadcast on the company 's campaign website , YesOnSEureka.com . She said the website should be active today -LRB- June 25 -RRB- . `` The June 30 event will be an information session , '' Page said . `` Participants will be able to submit questions both ahead of time and during the event . '' Page said residents can submit questions to the city or through the campaign website . The virtual meeting will be followed by three planned town hall meetings . Those meetings are each scheduled to start at 7 p.m. and will be held July 16 , 23 and 30 at the Timbers of Eureka , 1 Coffey Park Lane . Page said Debbie Dewey , president of Missouri American Water , and Eureka Mayor Sean Flower will make presentations at the town hall meetings , and other Missouri American Water employees will be available to address questions relating to their specific areas of expertise , such as water quality , engineering or operations . Page said the town halls are expected to last about 45 minutes , with presentations about the proposed sale lasting about 20 minutes , leaving the rest of the time for a question-and-answer period . `` We understand that this could be the most important decision that the voters make for the future of Eureka , '' said Julie Wood , Eureka 's city clerk and director of economic development and communication , who is helping coordinate the meetings along with other city officials . `` We want to make sure everybody has the ability to ask questions and get answers from the right people . We want to make sure the information out there is accurate , because this is a huge decision for our community . '' Wood said the city will ask residents attending meetings at the Timbers to follow guidelines put in place by St. Louis County to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 . Those guidelines include practicing social distancing and wearing a mask . The July meetings are expected to be recorded , and those meetings will be posted on the city 's website , eureka.mo.us , Wood said . `` The goal is that in August people are very educated -LRB- about the issue -RRB- and any concerns they have will be answered , '' Wood said . The city also is working with Missouri American Water to create a webpage on Eureka 's website to answer some commonly asked questions . Wood said one common question has to do with the city 's existing water pipes . If those are not replaced , people want to know how simply changing the water source will improve water quality , she said . Flower said in a Facebook post that , if the sale goes through , water would be supplied through Missouri American 's Wildwood plant . He said a purchase would take the city wells offline and give Missouri American Water responsibility for major upgrades . According to the offer letter , if voters approve the sale in August , the water system would switch to its new supply in mid - to late-2022 . Flower said he also plans to produce videos that will address some of the most commonly asked questions about the sale and make those videos available on the city 's website . `` People are busy , '' Flower said . `` It is one thing to get together for a social event or something that is fun , but to come up and listen to someone talk about water , if it was me , I would look at it like can I just get my question answered on a video . I think it will work out that it is helpful . `` The videos we did for Prop E were helpful , because people could watch them when they wanted . Also , they got information first , and then their questions got better . '' Prop E was a $ 15.9 million sales tax measure that voters approved in April 2018 . The proposition increased the city 's sales tax from 8.613 cents to 9.113 cents per $ 1 spent with the nearly $ 16 million in anticipated tax revenue slated to be spent on flood mitigation efforts , replacing the Allenton Bridge and constructing a new police building . `` When we did Prop E , we did town hall meetings , '' Flower said . `` I think we did four of them . We did n't have much attendance at the meetings . I do n't fault people for that . They are busy . So , the more you can make a video and let people watch it when they want , the better . I think it is easier . '' Flower has come out in favor of selling the city 's water and sewer systems to Missouri American Water . The mayor said the city 's sewer system must have capital improvements to stay up to code , and the city would have to raise rates prohibitively to cover the cost . He said the upgrades may cost residents less under Missouri American Water 's ownership . Flower also said water quality would improve if the water system is sold . He said the cash the city will receive could help make up for lost sales tax revenue from the last couple of months . An appraisal of Eureka 's water and sewer systems has valued both systems at a combined $ 28 million . The appraisal valued the water system at $ 18 million and the sewer system at $ 10 million . Missouri American Water is offering the full appraisal amount , and it plans to spend $ 37.2 million in capital improvements over the next five years . Because of existing debt , the city 's net cash proceeds from the deal would come to $ 20.7 million . Planned capital improvements include , but are not limited to , building a main extension to connect the Eureka water distribution system to Missouri American 's St. Louis County water supply and making sure the sewer system is compliant with federal and state regulations . According to Missouri American Water 's offer letter , an average water user 's bill would be about $ 78 a month for 6,400 gallons of water , compared to the current $ 62 average monthly charge . However , Missouri American Water also said it estimates that Eureka residents would save about $ 1,000 over the next five years if it covered the costs for system improvements instead of the city paying for the upgrades . `` We look forward to introducing ourselves to any residents who may be unfamiliar with Missouri American Water and sharing how we can enhance the city 's water quality and make needed investments in the sewer system to maintain regulatory compliance , '' Page said . `` Our main goal is to answer any questions that Eureka voters may have about the proposed sale .

The incident took place at 70th and Aetna streets , just north of Wisconsin Avenue and near the home of Wauwatosa Mayor Dennis McBride . Demonstrators have been upset with McBride since Thursday , when he tried to halt protests from taking place after 8 p.m. , and placed other requirements on protests in the city . Marches and other demonstrations have been common in the Milwaukee suburb since early June , as relatives and friends of three males killed over the last five years by Wauwatosa police Officer Joseph Mensah in the line of duty want Mensah , and Wauwatosa Police Chief Barry Weber to be fired . Mensah is currently suspended with pay . Dozens of police officers , many wearing riot gear , at first prevented the protesters from going west on Aetna Street . Eventually , the officers took one step back in unison several times as attorney Kim Motley , who represents the families of the deceased males , took one step forward toward the line of police . State Rep. David Bowen , D-Milwaukee , said the arrest was `` one of the actions of aggression by the Wauwatosa Police Department that are escalating situations instead of de-escalating situations . '' Bowen added , `` A number of people die in situations with law enforcement -LSB- across the U.S. -RSB- when law enforcement escalates situations . '' Bowen said McBride has a chance to `` fix this '' by seeing to it that Mensah and Weber are fired . Sean Lowe , chair of the Wauwatosa Equity and Inclusion Commission , said , `` I do n't want any protesters in jail , tonight or any night , just for legally observing the right to protest . I am urging the Wauwatosa Police Department to give multiple warnings before they arrest anybody . '' Late Friday , McBride dropped his requirement that protests in Wauwatosa be limited to the hours of 12-8 p.m. Around 12:45 a.m. Friday , about 50 people in cars protested outside McBride 's home .

Authorities went door to door in the aftermath of Sunday night 's fire , which jumped palm trees in the town Niland amid high winds . Imperial County said fire officials recovered one dead body , without elaborating on the person 's identity . Crews extinguished hot spots Monday after the fire was contained , according to the county health department . By afternoon , power was restored to 414 customers , while 91 were still without it . The cause of the blaze was under investigation . Niland is an economically depressed town of about 1,000 people in a desolate stretch of a county that regularly registers one of the highest unemployment rates in the United States . The county 's jobless rate stood at 27.8 % in May . It lies near Bombay Beach , a community that doubles to about 500 people during winter and has an apocalyptic feel . Utility poles and trailer debris that were flooded a few years ago are now exposed because the Salton Sea shrank . The Salton Sea was created n 1905 when the Colorado River breached a dike and flooded for two years , bringing farm settlers to the Imperial Valley in California 's southeast corner . California 's largest lake by surface area soon became a desert playground . A 1951 regatta boasted 21 world records . Celebrities including Frank Sinatra , Bing Crosby , the Beach Boys , Jerry Lewis , the Marx Brothers and Desi Arnaz flocked to the lake . The `` Salton Riviera '' rivaled nearby Palm Springs and attracted more tourists than Yosemite National Park . Tropical storms in 1976 and 1977 destroyed marinas and resorts , triggering a prolonged economic decline . Environmental catastrophes , rising salinity and a receding shoreline caused tourism to plummet . The Niland area draws retirees and some tourists . It is near a large , colorful sculpture called `` Salvation Mountain , '' which is painted with Christian sayings and Bible verses . `` Slab City , '' also nearby , is a scattered collection of off-the-grid dwellings on an abandoned military site .", "seg_content_paragraph_starts": "0 38 82 126 169 212 258 310 341", "simhash": "b7d32860d3d399216e69bdde5b71e2de", "spacy_content_loc": ["Calif.", "Salton Sea", "California", "Niland", "Imperial County", "the United States", "Bombay Beach", "Salton Sea", "The Salton Sea", "Colorado River", "the Imperial Valley", "California", "California", "Palm Springs", "Yosemite National Park", "Niland"], "spacy_content_num": ["one", "about 40", "one", "414", "91", "about 1,000", "one", "27.8 %", "about 500", "21"], "spacy_content_org": ["NILAND", "AP", "Niland", "Desi", "Christian"], "spacy_content_otr": ["the Beach Boys", "`` Salvation Mountain", "Bible"], "spacy_content_per": ["Frank Sinatra", "Bing Crosby", "Jerry Lewis", "Marx Brothers", "Arnaz"], "spacy_content_tim": ["Monday", "Sunday night 's", "Monday", "afternoon", "May", "winter", "a few years ago", "1905", "two years", "1951", "1976", "1977"], "spacy_title_loc": ["California"], "spacy_title_num": ["1", "40"], "spacy_title_org": [], "spacy_title_otr": [], "spacy_title_per": [], "spacy_title_tim": [], "text_category": {}, "title_c_count": 12, "tpc_m": {"t119": 0.16541844606399536}, "url": "https://apnews.com/0c5dce75eff8039a27dc89610c66c599"}

' There 's a freaking monkey hanging ... it looks like a monkey hanging from a noose , '' Parkhurst told ABC7 News . `` It was really daunting and eerie and weird , it is clearly a racial statement . '' Parkhurst , whose two-year-old son is biracial , was so rattled by the image that she snapped a couple of photos and shared them on Facebook , Nextdoor and with her close friend and neighbor , Jessica Wycliffe , who then reported it to police . `` Why is it on a lever ? Why is it attached to a shed ? I have a lot of questions about why , '' Wycliffe said about the monkey . Santa Rosa PD Sergeant Hector De Leon investigated the incident and told ABC7 News he showed up at the home near Brush Creek Trail , where the monkey was hanging and spoke to the residents . He said that , upon inspection , the rope was not a noose . He said the residents offered to remove the monkey but that they are not required to take it down because it is hanging from a tree on their private property . As of Monday morning , and despite growing concerns from others in the neighborhood who reached out to Parkhurst , the monkey had not been taken down . Instead , Parkhurst and Wycliffe noticed more items were added to it , including a green army man doll and a cardboard cat carrier . `` Seems like they 're kind of trolling and making fun of the people calling about it , '' Parkhurst said . `` I do n't know what they 're trying to say , '' Wyliffe added . `` Honestly , it kind of freaks me out . '' This is video of the monkey taken by Shannon Parkhurst . She was so rattled when she saw it that she snapped some photos , shared them on FB and told her friend Jessica , who reported it to police .

She said they hung it there two weeks ago and that it was `` silly '' that people reported it . `` It 's just a monkey hanging on a rope , '' she said , laughing . `` My husband likes to entertain people . '' When asked about the racial connotations , she said that was `` not on anybody 's thought process . '' She also said they have no plans to take it down . `` Why should we ? '' she replied . `` The officer said it was our backyard and we could do whatever we wanted to do . '' The phone call then abruptly ended and she could not be reached again . Even after complaints from neighbors + a visit from the police , the couple who put up this monkey says they do n't plan to take it down . `` Why should we ? '' the woman asked .

But it 's time we snap out of it and beat this plague with the can-do attitude that has characterized Americans ' character when faced with other seemingly insurmountable crises . When the Great Depression struck our parents and grandparents , they buckled down , worked hard and helped dig America out of the economic dumps . The government did its job with innovative social programs that wove an economic security net to break the financial free-fall . After the bombs fell at Pearl Harbor , Americans did n't crawl under the covers and shirk their responsibilities . They helped build a military-industrial juggernaut that overwhelmed dictators in both Germany and Japan . Young Americans answered the call by the millions to join in the armed forces that saved the world from tyranny . In our own time , after the twin towers fell on 9/11 , Americans again summoned the courage and fortitude to both comfort the victims of terrorism and confront its perpetrators . We not only rebuilt the World Trade Center , but also we regained our national sense of purpose to keep America strong and free . Evil lost ; goodness triumphed . Today we 're faced with an invisible , insidious enemy that has threatened our national health and battered our prosperity . Millions of Americans are still out of work , struggling to pay their mortgage or rent and put food on the table , and wondering if things will ever get back to any semblance of normal . We must dig deep to find the courage to meet this scourge . We can take our inspiration from the hundreds of thousands of health care workers and first responders who have shown us incredible courage every day in the face of danger and even death . Like the soldiers who stormed ashore at Normandy and the firefighters who ran up the steps of the twin towers as fire rained down , the brave Americans who are on the front lines in our hospitals and ambulances deserve our undying gratitude and respect . Likewise , the millions of essential workers who grow our food , make the products we ca n't live without and deliver them to our stores , businesses and homes . They 're all heroes . And as much as Americans like to find fault with their government and its leaders , the fact is that government at all levels has stepped up during this crisis with unprecedented support . Let 's not lose sight of the fact that Congress and President Trump have put aside sometimes bitter differences three times now to pump trillions of dollars into the economy . And the Federal Reserve has directed trillions more to maintaining financial liquidity that has so far kept us from another Great Depression . Economists tell us that given all this financial relief , the poverty rate has actually fallen during the past few months . The $ 1,200 stimulus checks , the $ 600-per-week unemployment insurance subsidy , the generous grants and loans to businesses large and small , the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Medicaid benefits - all have kept our economy on life support until the world 's scientists can produce a vaccine to finally beat back the pandemic . In New York , Gov. Andrew Cuomo , local leaders and health care professionals at all levels have worked valiantly fighting this virus . New York faced down the earliest and deadliest wave , and while we 're still not entirely out of danger , we 're mercifully ahead of much of the nation on the road to recovery . So where do we go from here as we face the latest signs that the virus is n't an easy enemy to defeat ? We double down on our determination to beat it . Congress is considering another round of financial relief for the nation . It needs to think and act intelligently . Rather than blindly throwing trillions more at the pandemic , the next round of relief should be focused on bolstering our health care system to fight the virus , directing `` job bonuses '' to workers to get them back to work , helping small businesses hang on , helping state and local governments maintain vital services , and getting our kids back to school . Here on Long Island , that last item - the safe return of students to the classroom - should be priority No. 1 . Cuomo has laid out clear guidance to get our schools up and running .

And it does n't care if you 've been good or bad , black brown or white . The only way for Covid to survive is to find human beings as hosts . That 's the only way it can stay alive . And it 's very , very good at doing that , which is partly why it 's so nasty . It 's also mean in another respect . It has forced us , as a result of the shut-down , to face some of our past economic sins . Let 's start with the myth about America 's strong economy . I am referring to the fantasy that all of us in America are doing swell . This fantasy has us all reaping the benefits of our unique , broad , all-encompassing prosperity . That 's what the folks in power wanted us to believe . Every day , the Fed , the president 's chief economist , Mr. Kudlow , as well as others , tell us that we 'll soon be fine because we have the most powerful economy in the world . It took this ruthless virus to lay bare the truth of our actual situation . And now we are forced to see clearly why America has a roughly 30 vs. 70 percent split between the haves and the have-not-enoughs . The top 30 percent are doing wonderfully well . And that top third drive the national average to the extent that the country as a whole looks as if it 's the best in the world . They are doing great ; but they live in the comfort and security of safe apartments or suburban settings with adequate support to insulate them from both the pandemic -- and its economic consequences . Our history , though , over the past four decades has demonstrated how that top third of the population has siphoned off the benefits of capitalism , which generated a remarkable state of wealth for that demographic . The unholy bargain in all this was that north of 90 percent of aggregate business profit went to shareholders , stoked by stock buybacks and excessive dividends . The stock market , as a byproduct of the Fed 's ferocious efforts to protect the banks and other businesses , continues to guard the wealth of the haves , even during this pandemic . Along Main Street , though , the core of the American economy -- small and mid-sized businesses -- are the most vulnerable . Much of this other have-less America lives and works in that zone . These are the folks who have been fired , docked , and furloughed into submission , who joined up with the millions in the 20 percent of the population already unemployed before the shut down -- many of whom should have been working . The most vulnerable of all turned out to be in the black communities caught with almost no defenses , with little or no funds to see them through this economic drought . Or the old folks sequestered together , prey for a virus that always seeks and often finds them defenseless and weak . Covid-19 also revealed the fact that our segregated education by income bracket -- good schools in wealthy and lower-quality schools in less privileged zip codes -- created the lack of opportunity borne out by our sky-high unemployment . -LRB- Again the black community is in the forefront of the suffering . -RRB- So when is enough enough ? Faced with the economic devastation , with decades and centuries of oppression , with persecution of immigrants now laid bare before us , the chorus screams loud and consistently , the time for change is now . It 's easy to see the emperor has no clothes , and it 's time to call attention to it . The American people confronted by the naked reality of inequality in wealth and opportunity is willing to say all at once , `` Enough . '' Time to live up to the dreams we once had of the good life for all . We need to reinvent America , to realize the possibility of the American Dream . The dream is to be the best one can be : to have the opportunity and means to achieve that through hard work . As an American immigrant off the boat -LRB- in my case , the airplane -RRB- I got the chance to live that dream . Others did as well , but not enough of them . So how can business help change these inequities ? Well , the truth of how crucial business will be stands front and center : the private sector is the only institution that can produce prosperity and growth . Government can offer incentives , can support and help nurture growth , and keep business on the right path through regulation , but only businesses can produce economic growth itself . Addressing the needs of a reimagined America must start with a set of rules for capitalism that direct business to produce inclusive growth -- prosperity for all . The idea is already current as a new paradigm : Stakeholder Capitalism . It 's remarkably similar to the version of capitalism that reigned during the 50s and 60s , when companies nurtured employees in ways that made America the economic powerhouse of the world . The way Stakeholder Capitalism works is right there in its name : workers , customers , shareholders , the corporation itself , its communities and the environment all sit at the table when the company charts its future . They all must be optimized . They all have to benefit , all have to win . Gone is shareholder primacy where business was driven to maximize the income of shareholders often against the interests of all the other constituents a business relies upon to succeed . That 's the business governance that , over the past four decades , has eroded America 's middle class and discarded the American Dream for most of our citizens . Stakeholder capitalism is still a work in progress . People favor it . Business leaders say it 's the right way to run a company . But backsliding is easy in hard times . It 's not a done deal . In the days ahead , I 'll keep trying my best to see that Stakeholder Capitalism takes hold . We ca n't waste this moment ripe with the opportunity to embrace this new paradigm . Better days ahead depend on Stakeholder Capitalism 's producing the fuel for a better America . Covid-19 is one of the meanest , nastiest health threats we 've yet faced . We must and we will defeat it . Yet maybe it could do us some good in at least one respect . It did remind us of how many Americans are being left behind economically and made it even more imperative for the private sector to see how crucial it is for everyone in America to thrive . It 's all up to us .", "seg_content_paragraph_starts": "0 112 208 285 320 421 555 607 613 788 1047 1088 1139", "simhash": "8cdb837efb9901b7f82e41ddd55a7bdf", "spacy_content_loc": ["America", "America", "America", "Main Street", "America", "America", "America", "America"], "spacy_content_num": ["roughly 30", "70 percent", "30 percent", "third", "third", "90 percent", "millions", "the 20 percent"], "spacy_content_org": ["Covid", "Fed", "Fed", "American", "American", "American", "American"], "spacy_content_otr": [], "spacy_content_per": ["Kudlow"], "spacy_content_tim": ["the past four decades", "the 50s and 60s"], "spacy_title_loc": [], "spacy_title_num": ["19"], "spacy_title_org": [], "spacy_title_otr": [], "spacy_title_per": [], "spacy_title_tim": [], "text_category": {}, "title_c_count": 9, "tpc_m": {"t405": 0.1620369255542755, "t862": 0.12791313230991364, "t21": 0.17712923884391785}, "url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/justcapital/2020/06/29/could-covid-19-be-good-for-us/", "ne_title_location": {}, "ne_title_organization": {}, "ne_title_person": {}}

And the 2017 draft going utterly bust -LRB- see No. 9 -RRB- . On one level , it 's no great surprise McMillan was traded as you saw this August lay out . He was n't getting high-profile work . His talent is n't covering players or blitzing . He was a first-down linebacker , a short-yardage player ... and this coaching staff puts a premium on versatility . On another level , they dumped a second-round pick from 2017 for ... nothing . McMillan had a good last season , by all accounts , after being hurt as a rookie and struggling his second year . But this trade brings up the constant question : A team building with draft picks ca n't keep throwing away valuable ones . The question asked when McMillan was drafted remains : Is a limited defender worth a second-round pick ? Well , evidently not . 2 . Ryan Fitzpatrick not playing in Saturday 's scrimmage due to his mother dying . Football takes a backseat here , obviously . `` He left to be with his family , '' coach Brian Flores said . ' There 's no quarterback controversy . '' That said , let 's approach this from a football angle . How big a deal was it football-wise ? We 'll see coming up . This was the one chance to get on the field in a game-like situation . Flores said he 'd give Fitzpatrick as much time as he needs . You 'd expect him to be back for the opener in New England . But it 's his life and his decision . 3 . Tua Tagovailoa looks better than Josh Rosen . Again , this is a fluid situation with such minimal work done this offseason . Tagovailoa , no big surprise , has looked much better this second week of practice . He made throws in the scrimmage that spoke of his big talent . You 're seeing that . His head probably stopped spinning and the practices slowed down . He led the first-team offense to a field goal in the first possession , making a couple of nice passes . In the scrimmage he struggled for stretches , too . He got intercepted by Eric Rowe on the second down of the third series . He came right back on his next throw to complete a beautiful 26-yard pass to Isaiah Ford . Back to the first game : The other issue is it 's at New England . Meaning it 's against Bill Belichick . Meaning it 's not exactly a perfect situation to bring out a rookie quarterback starting his first game . We 'll see . `` Overall , it was n't where I want it to be , '' Tua said of his play Saturday . That 's what this time is about , right ? 4 . Left tackle Austin Jackson and right tackle Robert Hunt got extensive playing time in the scrimmage . And the thought is whoever is playing a lot these scrimmages will start . Meanwhile , guard Solomon Kindley , who had been praised the first week of practice , was n't getting as much high-profile time . And guard Jesse Davis was getting extensive time . On a line with lots of change this offseason , nothing seems settled -- even if this scrimmage should have been the decider for who 's starting . 5 . Xavien Howard played in the scrimmage and knocked own a pass . Howard returned to practice from knee/COVID -19 absences on Friday , as I wrote in my column , and has two weeks to get ready . There 's no reason he should n't be if he 's as healthy as advertised . And as his pass defense Saturday showed he 'll make an impact . 6 . Josh Rosen ? He made a couple of nice back-shoulder passes . He rolled right and completed a 10-yard pass to tight end Adam Shaheen . He threw touchdown that Richardo Louis made a good play on a ball Rosen admitted was slightly underthrown -LRB- the only touchdown of the day -RRB- . Then , like Tua , on the third series he threw a bad pass with bad thinking behind it . He threw a bad pass that safety Clayton Fejedelem intercepted over the middle . `` Definitely a sloppy day on offense , '' Rosen said . 7 . Just wondering : Has a rookie quarterback ever started in the NFL with two rookie tackles ? 8 . The Dolphin have done all sorts of work and spent millions in advancing racial issues and equality . But they oddly kept players from talking Friday -- or the players did n't want to talk . Either way , there was no message from the Dolphins players while full teams and full sports were out front on the subject . They are one of the models of progress in sports with a Black General Manager and a Black head coach . They talked about the issues Friday with on the field among themselves and again afterward in the locker room . It just seems an organization at the forefront of showing how to progress inside the sports and in the community would have relevant things to say . But in a sports world flowing with this discussion , here was a muted team . On to New England . 9 . Still sinking in : Dolphins 2017 draft now that McMillan was shipped away for nothing : 1 . Charles Harris ... 2 . McMillan ... 3 . Cordrea Tankersley ... 5 . Isaac Asiata ... 5 . Davon Godchaux ... 6 . Vincent Taylor ... 7 . Isaiah Ford . The only player with some production thus far is Godchaux . Ford remains a hope . That 's an awful draft . It 's why the Dolphins are in this situation . 10 . We 're 14 days from the opener . Nothing seems normal , including that time frame . With no preseason and limited training camp , it 's hard to believe the opener is that close to happening .", "seg_content_paragraph_starts": "0 21 77 161 285 465 486 496 590 659 748 760 779 930 948 953 957 962 967 972 977 982 1014", "simhash": "9f91b909ab95d7ef2204ef7edd067e0d", "spacy_content_loc": ["New England", "New England", "New England"], "spacy_content_num": ["one", "first", "second", "second", "second", "2", "one", "3", "first", "first", "second", "third", "first", "first", "4", "5", "6", "third", "7", "two", "8", "millions", "one", "9", "2017", "1", "2", "3", "5", "5", "6", "7"], "spacy_content_org": ["Tua", "Tua", "NFL", "Dolphin"], "spacy_content_otr": ["Dolphins"], "spacy_content_per": ["McMillan", "McMillan", "McMillan", "McMillan", "Ryan Fitzpatrick", "Brian Flores", "Flores", "Fitzpatrick", "Tua Tagovailoa", "Josh Rosen", "Tagovailoa", "Eric Rowe", "Isaiah Ford", "Bill Belichick", "Austin Jackson", "Robert Hunt", "Solomon Kindley", "Jesse Davis", "Xavien Howard", "Howard", "Josh Rosen", "Adam Shaheen", "Richardo Louis", "Rosen", "Clayton Fejedelem", "Rosen", "McMillan", "Charles Harris", "McMillan", "Cordrea Tankersley", "Isaac Asiata", "Davon Godchaux", "Vincent Taylor", "Isaiah Ford", "Godchaux"], "spacy_content_tim": ["2017", "August", "2017", "Saturday", "this second week", "Saturday", "the first week", "Friday", "two weeks", "Saturday", "Friday", "Friday"], "spacy_title_loc": [], "spacy_title_num": ["Ten"], "spacy_title_org": ["Hyde10"], "spacy_title_otr": ["Dolphins"], "spacy_title_per": [], "spacy_title_tim": [], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"Sports": 1.0}, "second_cat": {"Sports_Football": 1.0}, "third_cat": {"Sports_Football_NFL": 1.0}}, "title_c_count": 9, "tpc_m": {"t871": 0.5379452705383301, "t332": 0.14758673310279846}, "url": "https://www.orlandosentinel.com/sports/miami-dolphins/fl-sp-hyde10-dolphins-scrimmage-20200829-rcca26rpmjfgzjfzh2rarqovsm-story.html"}	{"_id": "0PTOf5LO", "c_word": 908, "channels": ["NFL^^Draft", "NFL^^Players"], "countries": "", "date": "2020-06-29 04:00:00", "domain": "thedraftnetwork.com", "epoch": {"$numberLong": "1593403200"}, "geotag": [], "highlightkeyword_list": [["Micheal^^Clemons", 0.027313675575675496], ["Caleb^^Farley", 0.003938895074876022], ["Kellen^^Mond", 0.0038195271450765225], ["Shane^^Buechele", 0.0022804675781985507], ["Tyree^^Johnson", 0.0022596501568500145], ["Jimbo^^Fisher", 0.0020448793216845283], ["Jeff^^Okudah", 0.0017433863106929228], ["Kellen^^Trask", 0.0014311243185530544], ["Joe^^Marino", 0.001306607502629356], ["Virginia^^Tech", 0.0010832842656435353], ["Daylon^^Mack", 7.792411901514808E-4], ["Jordan^^Reid", 7.792411901514808E-4], ["Shaun^^Wade", 6.068399681637036E-4], ["K.J.^^Costello", 5.652937071673445E-4], ["NFL", 4.716862856751218E-6], ["SMU", 9.847917550440204E-7], ["Surtain", 9.674535992495156E-7], ["Aggies", 9.302679703338618E-7]], "kw_title": ["NFL^^Draft"], "kws": ["NFL^^Draft", "Senior^^QB^^class", "prospects", "Texas^^A&M", "in-depth^^today", "325-pound^^Brown^^III", "wideout", "zone^^coverage", "Jordan^^Reid", "Aggies", "summer^^evaluations", "SMU", "Daylon^^Mack", "Shane^^Buechele", "Jordan", "numerous^^players", "TDN", "Jeff^^Okudah", "Virginia^^Tech", "double^^teams"], "ne_content_location": {"Texas": 3}, "ne_content_organization": {"Texas A&M": 3, "Aggies": 1, "SMU": 2, "Carter Donnick Publications Intern Publications Intern": 1, "NFL": 2, "Virginia Tech": 1}, "ne_content_person": {"Buechele": 1, "Kyle Crabbs": 1, "Shane Buechele": 1, "Asante Samuel Jr.": 1, "Reid": 7, "Kellen Trask": 1, "Surtain": 1, "K.J.

Currently going through summer evaluations for the 2021 NFL Draft class , our scouting team of Kyle Crabbs , Joe Marino , Jordan Reid , and Drae Harris are meeting up every day to discuss prospects , traits , and concepts . New to TDN is a daily scouting roundtable where we go through and identify the most important points of conversation from that day 's meeting . On Monday , we talked about numerous players , concepts , and draft-related concepts . Here are my three main takeaways from the meeting . 1 . Texas A&M has some dudes Given our scouting staff is mostly taking specific regions during summer scouting , Reid has been assigned essentially all the Texas schools . After reviewing what Jimbo Fisher and company have going on down at Texas A&M , he 's been quite impressed with the Aggies . `` I knew they had players , but not to that extent , '' Reid noted . Reid brought three Texas A&M defenders to the table today -LRB- Micheal Clemons , Tyree Johnson , and Bobby Brown III -RRB- , giving each draftable grades heading into 2020 . Impressed with Clemons the most , Reid made sure to note that the dangly edge rusher was thin-limbed and underdeveloped , but strong as an ox when asked to set the edge in the run game . Playing extremely hard with a non-stop motor , Reid also stated that Clemons lacked true bend as a rusher , but could develop into a starting strong-side edge in time . With Johnson , meanwhile , Reid made sure to discuss his athleticism and explosiveness , two strong traits that helped him garner four sacks a season ago . Playing with solid , low leverage , Johnson has quite a few issues , but it 's that raw frame that will likely appeal to a team wanting a 3-4 OLB in the later rounds . Saving the biggest for last , Reid described the 6-foot-4 , 325-pound Brown III as a `` super stout defender who eats up double teams . '' No , he 's not a pressure generator , but the big defensive tackle can be a prime pocket pusher , similar to Daylon Mack -- another Texas A&M prospect -- who was drafted in the fifth round a few years ago . 2 . Senior QB class is weak It seems like each year senior quarterback classes are getting weaker and weaker . Unfortunately , 2021 does n't seem to be an exception to this disappointing trend . Lacking a true star and any potential first-round selection , the class -- barring anyone rising in a Joe Burrow-like fashion -- is straight up dreadful . Highlighting the group are names like Kellen Mond , Kellen Trask , and K.J. Costello , but none are truly proven at this point . Maybe the most productive prospect in this regard is SMU 's Shane Buechele , a flashy passer who Marino discussed in-depth today . A Texas transfer , Buechele `` quickly mastered SMU 's air raid system , '' performing exceptionally down the field on vertical shots . Able to feel the rush and step up when appropriate , he has the anticipation and nuance to succeed , particularly in a Senior Bowl setting . Unfortunately , as Marino made sure to point out , his physical traits are very underwhelming , leaving his upside as virtually non-existent . He 's a nice player who Marino currently gives a late-round grade , but if he 's the best -- or at least close to the best -- this senior class has , we 're in for some trouble . 3 . Farley can challenge for CB1 The CB1 debate in 2020 was n't an overly interesting one , with Jeff Okudah claiming that spot on nearly every board . Although it 's extremely early , 2021 looks like it 'll be a lot closer , with -LRB- familiar -RRB- names like Patrick Surtain II , Shaun Wade , and Asante Samuel Jr. leading the way . Although he does n't play at a powerhouse , Virginia Tech 's Caleb Farley more than deserves to be in the same discussion , however , as was made very clear in today 's meeting . A former high school QB and starting his VT career at wideout , Farley , as Marino notes , `` does n't look new to the position at all . '' Sticky in coverage and displaying exceptional click and close ability , Farley is the definition of a physical , press-man corner . He 's able to use his movement skills and frame to his advantage , but Marino does mention that he could improve a bit in zone coverage -LRB- and also stay healthier -RRB- but is simply a stud in nearly every other aspect . With Wade having yet to play outside , Samuel still developing , and Surtain struggling a bit with contact , it 's more than fair to assume Farley could claim the 2021 CB1 title . Giving him a top-32 grade , it seems Marino may already agree . Written By : Carter Donnick Publications Intern Publications Intern at The Draft Network .

Ziaja Tropical Butter Hand Creams , $ 2.99 . Available from Boots , Lloyds , select Dunnes Stores , select SuperValu stores & pharmacies nationwide . Vicki Murnane From : Cork Verdict : 5/5 I 've always loved these hand creams , but my go-to was the Moisturising Hand Cream for Very Dry Skin . My hands are always dry and weathered looking so I 've tried quite a few products . This cream was so lovely and light but still effective , with no greasy residue and a beautifully delicate scent that adds to the experience . Grace Glanville From : Cork Verdict : 5/5 My favourite of the new Tropical Hand Creams was the Smoothing Hand Cream for Rough and Irritated Skin . For the past three weeks , I have used it every time after I washed my hands and I found it creamy and rich . It 's an anti-aging cream too so I used it just before bed and I noticed that my hands became smoother and plumper if that is possible . Ziaja is on par with the more expensive creams and is a necessity for your handbag and night-time ritual .

Bill Lee and state legislators in an effort to address losses from the ongoing coronavirus pandemic . The money is part of a $ 210.43 million pot getting divvied up among the state 's 95 counties and 345 municipalities as the result of a decision by Lee and lawmakers to double a previously approved $ 100 million infrastructure grant fund for local governments . As a result of the increase , Hamilton County government , which is getting the largest amount in the county , will see nearly $ 4.17 million . The city of Chattanooga comes in a close second at $ 4.01 million , with East Ridge ranking No. 3 with $ 493,968 . Soddy-Daisy is slated to receive $ 332,714 , while Red Bank will see $ 289,636 , closely followed by Collegedale with $ 283,610 . The fund is providing Signal Mountain with $ 219,060 . Walden gets $ 77,270 , while Lookout Mountain will see $ 71,180 . That 's followed by $ 71,026 for Lakesite and $ 39,534 for Ridgeside . The goal is providing local governments some financial relief in light of lost tax revenues due to the coronavirus pandemic , which prompted weekslong closures of many businesses while also resulting in new COVID-19-related spending . Gone are the original provisions restricting use of the money solely for infrastructure needs such as road , building construction or repair and vehicle replacement . Local governments can use it for any purpose , including recurring programs . Grant amounts are largely based on population . Towns , cities and counties will see the money by July 31 , said Lola Potter , spokeswoman for the state Department of Finance and Administration . The program was created despite massive cuts in the state 's own budget . Not just for infrastructure Senate Finance Committee Chairman Bo Watson , R-Hixson , noted that `` originally the governor had proposed the grant program for local governments to use for infrastructure . '' But when lawmakers returned to the Capitol on June 1 and began `` considering the budget and putting our fingerprints on it , we just decided that unlike the federal government had restricted our hands with the CARES Act money , we did not want to do the same thing with local government , '' Watson said . Watson and fellow Republicans have bristled under spending restrictions in Congress ' Coronavirus Aid , Relief , and Economic Security -LRB- CARES -RRB- Act , which is providing some $ 3.66 billion in aid to Tennessee . `` So we elected to just eliminate an application process and not tell local governments how they needed to spend the money because we decided they probably knew better than we did how they needed to spend their resources , '' Watson said . `` Local people are elected by the same people who elect us and we expect them to be held accountable to their electorate in the same way we are . '' That includes allowing local governments to put the funds toward recurring expenses if that 's what they decide is necessary to weather the financial crisis . Moreover , Watson said , `` we would ask the same thing -LSB- flexibility -RSB- from our federal friends , that they loosen the directives so we can address some of the shortfalls in our state and local budgets . '' Finance spokeswoman Potter said local governments will be audited on the use of the funds . While Lee had asked to double the grant program to $ 200 million , it increased to the $ 210.43 million figure after House Republicans snatched $ 10.3 million of the funds designated for the state 's three largest governments -- Shelby County , the city of Memphis and Metro Nashville . Largely rural Republicans argued that was justified since the governments were getting huge amounts of CARES Act funding . Democrats countered the federal funding was tightly restricted in how it could be spent . Republican senators trimmed the House GOP 's original proposal to the $ 10.3 million figure . How to use it While Hamilton County Mayor Jim Coppinger and his spokesman did n't respond to Times Free Press inquiries last week on how the county intends to use its grant money , several local towns and cities did . The cities of Chattanooga and East Ridge , as well as the town of Signal Mountain , are sticking with their original plans to put the money toward infrastructure and related one-time expense needs . Chattanooga intends to use its $ 4.01 million allotment on road infrastructure and vehicle fleet replacement with $ 1,734,641 going toward paving and $ 2,279,975 designated for replacing aging vehicles . `` In a year where we 're seeing lost revenues in Chattanooga and across Tennessee , we 're grateful that funds were made available by the state so we can continue to provide services at the level our residents deserve , '' said Chief Operating Officer Maura Sullivan . State Rep. Esther Helton , R-East Ridge , who is also the vice mayor of East Ridge , said , `` we 're really excited about the $ 493,000 . We 're going to use that on IT hardware and we 're going to place some laptops in police cars . '' Other plans , Helton said , call for paving projects and capital improvements including access improvements under the Americans with Disabilities Act for City Hall . `` It 's already accessible , but we 're going to move that to the front of the building , '' Helton said . Another project : Improvements of the city 's Fire and Police Station No. 1 building with plans including new flooring , painting and improved restrooms . The town of Signal Mountain 's share is budgeted for paving projects and replacing radios for the fire and police departments , also allowable uses under the original grant program . Town Manager Boyd Veal said the town would have budgeted the same amounts for those expenditures if it had not received the funds from the state grant . `` I think that was the intent , being an assistance grant , to help us do things we normally would be doing -- which it certainly does , '' Veal said . `` Without those funds , the budget would ultimately look different . We 're projecting as of now that we 'll put a little bit of money into fund balance . `` Without that grant , we would be taking money out of fund balance if we funded everything that 's in the budget . It helped us do everything we need to do without reducing fund balance , '' Veal added . Bridgett Raper with the Small Cities Coalition of Hamilton County , which represents other towns and cities in the county , said `` most cities were planning to use their grants for road projects that were removed from next year 's budget . However , with the legislators ' recent change in restrictions , that could possibly change . '' Contact Andy Sher at asher@timesfreepress.com or 615-255-0550 . Follow him on Twitter @AndySher1 .

However , the current North Idaho mask mandate does not require masks for those with a medical condition , nor does it require documentation of such a condition . According to the mandate issued by Panhandle Health District : `` Facial coverings are not required for the following circumstances ... Persons with medical conditions , mental health conditions , or disability that prevent them from wearing a face covering . A person is not required to provide documentation demonstrating that the person can not tolerate wearing a face covering . '' It also states that masks are not required for persons `` whose wearing a face covering would create a risk to the person related to their work , as determined by ... workplace safety guidelines . '' Katherine Hoyer , communications officer for PHD , encouraged the public to read the current mandate and do their best to prevent the spread of coronavirus . `` We already have those exemptions for medical conditions , '' she said . `` Our concern is bringing down the rising numbers , and that happens with behavior changes . '' Regarding mask mandates and the ADA , Benjamin Earwicker , chief administrator of the Idaho Human Rights Commission , a state administrative law agency for discrimination cases , stated : `` Regardless of the pandemic , businesses still have to comply with the ADA . '' In Idaho , the HRC , within the Idaho Department of Labor , is responsible for investigating and enforcing discrimination law , including the ADA . The ADA is a complex 1990 federal law that prohibits discrimination based on disability . The ADA requires most businesses to provide `` reasonable accommodation '' to employees and accessibility for publicly offered services . The HRC website reads : `` Our Purpose : To investigate complaints by individuals who claim they have experienced a discriminatory practice in the areas of employment , housing , education and public accommodations . '' The commissioners who administer HRC policy are appointed by the governor . When it comes to the ADA and COVID-19 , Earwicker said , `` We 're receiving a whole range of inquiries and complaints . Our baseline is Idaho statute regardless of the situation . Our analysis is consistent with any disability inquiry . '' In regard to mask mandates and the ADA , he said , `` We 're delicately addressing it . It 's tricky and where it gets trickier is employment situations . They still have to comply with federal law . There is not a lot a business can do to ask about the nature of a disability . But to get accommodation , they must have a qualifying disability . '' Businesses that ask for masks still must reasonably accommodate those who can not wear them . `` For a business , accommodation can be any alternative offered to the public , such as delivery or curbside service . It 's where they have no alternative that they run afoul of the law . '' Earwicker described the HRC as `` in many ways , a precursor to court . '' `` For us the process typically begins with a complaint , '' he said . `` We then have a fact-finding legal analysis . Remember , to get accommodation you must have a qualifying documented disability . '' `` Our neutrality is a message I want to get out , '' Earwicker said . `` We are tasked with both fact and law . '' Those who can not wear a face mask due to an existing condition are encouraged to discuss options and be flexible in seeking accommodation . Businesses or individuals with concerns can reach out to the Idaho HRC for further guidance .

Just how exactly is the mandate going to be enforced . For the most part so far across the state any kind of enforcement of the mandate has been voluntary . And if there was any such enforcement what would the punishment actually be ? That 's vague as well . The state has said the order could be potentially enforced as a misdemeanor which would be accompanied by a fine or worse . One agency that could be used to enforce the mandate is the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health . As far as any kind of local enforcement , Tulare County Sheriff Mike Boudreaux said his office is n't enforcing the mandate . And Porterville Police stated it will only answer calls if the matter of wearing a mask becomes an issue but it wo n't be making any citations or arrests for not wearing a mask . For the time being as long as face coverings are a mandate , it 's more about education than enforcement much in the same way as wearing a seat belt and not smoking in public became accepted . States , including California , have a `` Click or Ticket '' campaign in which people can be given tickets for not wearing their seat belt . When it came to essentially not allowing smoking in public , the state placed the duty of that enforcement onto local and county jurisdictions . Theoretically , local law enforcement or health agencies can enforce no smoking restrictions but practices such as not smoking in public and wearing a seat belt have become virtually automatic . Newsom has said state and local agencies could be called upon to `` exercise a little bit of persuasion '' when it comes to the mask mandate . When it comes to the state level , any state agency that regulates licenses for businesses could possibly be used to enforce the requirement . But Newsom basically said he wants any kind of enforcement to be really a last resort and is also depending on education . `` We 're not looking to fine people , '' he has said . `` We 're looking to education people , encourage people . And to the extent that people flaunt and abuse , which may be the exception , then we have many tools in the tool kit . '' As far as if Newsom has the authority to issue such a mandate the answer is yes . Under the California Emergency Services Act Newsom can issue health mandates during a pandemic . And unless face coverings are shown to be ineffective , Newsom 's mandate would likely hold up against any legal challenge .", "seg_content_paragraph_starts": "0 32 63 126 184 222 249 305 333 358 381 433 466", "simhash": "de8a4d3e69f1fdb2b5ae4b172e9d7cff", "spacy_content_loc": ["Tulare County", "California"], "spacy_content_num": ["One"], "spacy_content_org": ["Californians", "the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health", "Porterville Police", "Newsom", "the California Emergency Services Act Newsom"], "spacy_content_otr": ["`` Click or Ticket ''"], "spacy_content_per": ["Gavin Newsom", "Mike Boudreaux", "Newsom", "Newsom", "Newsom"], "spacy_content_tim": ["more than a week"], "spacy_title_loc": [], "spacy_title_num": [], "spacy_title_org": [], "spacy_title_otr": [], "spacy_title_per": [], "spacy_title_tim": [], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"PoliticsGovernment": 0.8937114477157593, "CrimePublicsafety": 0.9999783039093018}, "second_cat": {"PoliticsGovernment_Municipal": 0.8937114477157593, "CrimePublicsafety_Other": 0.9999783039093018}}, "title_c_count": 7, "tpc_m": {"t114": 0.21200008690357208}, "url": "https://www.recorderonline.com/news/mask-requirement-pretty-much-voluntary-for-now/article_bd5c8128-ba22-11ea-9ac0-9b85f8ba2d07.html"}

They do n't call us the `` Monumental City '' for nothing . We earned that title the hard way with fabulous memorials and statues that are a tribute to our talented citizens , to our rich heritage , and to the designing artists , whose works we so joyfully celebrate . The `` Washington Monument , '' the centerpiece of picturesque Mt. Vernon Place , was our first statue that gained national recognition . It speaks volumes about how we earned that title . It sits on land dedicated to the city by the Revolutionary War patriot , John Eager Howard . His equestrian monument also can be seen in Mt. Vernon Place . It was designed , in 1904 , by Emmanuel Fremiet . Our Washington Monument was completed in 1829 . It was designed by the same brilliant architect , Robert Mills , who would go on to design the famous memorial to General George Washington in the nation 's capital . Further south , in the middle of Calvert Street , at its intersection with Fayette , -LRB- dividing Court House East from Court House West -RRB- , you will find the `` Battle Monument . '' It was completed in 1815 and is dedicated , not to any famous individual , but to the soldiers and sailors -- the unsung heroes -- who died in the War of 1812-14 This included the Battle at North Point and the courageous defense of Fort McHenry against the forces of Imperial Britain . Architect Maximillian M. Godefroy , gets credit for the Battle Monument . It was considered `` very democratic '' for its time , '' since it records `` the names of all who died , regardless of rank . '' Two recent statues deserve mention . One , located in front of the War Memorial , facing our City Hall , is the Black Soldier Memorial . It is dedicated to African-Americans who fought in America 's wars . Another statue , located in the Inner Harbor , is to honor the memory of our former mayor and governor , William Donald Schaefer . -LRB- I am pleased to note that I worked in his administration , in the City Solicitor 's Office , in the 1970s , under City Solicitor George L. Russell , Jr. and now deceased , Benjamin Brown . Both Russell and Brown were exemplary public servants . -RRB- Now , let 's discuss an iconic aspect of Baltimore -- its Port . The noted maritime editor , and journalist , for the `` Sun , '' the late Helen Delich Bentley , created a television show from 1955 to 1965 . It extolled the importance of our port to both our city and to our state . In it , she gave credit to both the businesses who worked it , but also to the hard-working members of the International Longshoremen 's Association -LRB- ILA -RRB- , who labored on its docks . -LRB- 1 -RRB- The ILA has a special place in my heart . My first job was on the waterfront , in the late 1950s , as a cargo facilitator for the Alcoa S/S Co , at pier 9 , n/s , Locust Point . I was then a member of two ILA Locals -- 829 and 1429 . Local 829 was later succeeded by Local 333 . My late father , Richard P. Hughes , Sr. , was the boss at pier 9 . His oldest son , and my brother , the late Richard P. Hughes , Jr. , also worked on the docks . He rose up to become the ILA President from 2007 -- 2011 . He was so highly-regarded that , he was honored by its members at its convention in 2011 , with the title of `` President Emeritus . '' In the attached poster , `` Best of Baltimore , '' I have spotlighted some of its monuments and aspects that I feel are most noteworthy . They are not intended to be a complete list , but simply representative of our bountiful heritage . You will find there : A view of our city from Federal Hill ; various waterfront images ; our splendid City Hall ; Johns Hopkins Hospital ; the Museum of Art ; the War Memorial ; Fells Point ; Locust Point ; Penn Station ; the vessel , `` Port of Baltimore , II ; '' the World Trade Center ; the Jones Falls ; Silo Point , and the facade of Memorial Stadium which once stood for so long and so proudly , on 33rd Street . Some of the sports heroes , whose extraordinary achievements with the Baltimore Colts and the Baltimore Orioles were made at that stadium , have recently been memorialized . They are the Hall of Fame legends : Brooks `` No. 5 '' Robinson , -LRB- Third Baseman for the Orioles -RRB- ; John `` No. 19 '' Unitas , -LRB- Quarterback for the Colts -RRB- ; and Ray -LRB- No. 52 '' Lewis , -LRB- Linebacker for the Ravens -RRB- . Lewis ' football heroics were all at the M&T Bank Stadium . Lewis ' statue , as well as the one to Unitas , are found directly in front of the M&T Bank Stadium . They both look fabulous ! They were designed by Fred Kail . The Brooks Robinson monument , on the other hand , is located across the street and just west of the M&T Bank Stadium . The distinguished sculptor , Joseph Sheppard , gets credit for that one . It , too , is simply beautiful . -LRB- In his salad days , Sheppard taught at the Maryland School for the Arts . -RRB- And let 's not forget the museum , at 216 Emory Street , to one of our cities ' greatest sons -- the professional baseball legend -- George Herman `` Babe '' Ruth . Visit https://baberuthmuseum.org/ to get started on that exciting journey . There is also a bronze sculpture to Ruth found at Camden Yards . It was designed in 1996 , by Susan Luery and is entitled , `` Babe 's Dream . '' I would be remiss if I did n't say a word about the Christopher Columbus monument controversy . It was recently brought down , in the Inner Harbor East area , by so-called `` protesters '' and dumped into the Inner Harbor . I believe in and support the right to protest . However , in my opinion , vandalism and the destruction of public or private property do not fit that description . That kind of conduct is counterproductive and ca n't be condoned . Finally , if you are interested in learning more about Baltimore , its monuments , iconic sites and rich heritage , then visit the website of the `` Maryland Historical Society .

When the cornerstone of the eagerly-awaited building was laid on October 2 , 1873 , a ceremony was held which rivaled anything Lansing had seen since becoming the capital a quarter of a century earlier . People thronged to the city in numbers far exceeding its capacity . Private citizens opened their homes and made preparations to feed and shelter the visitors . Materials for the building came from all over the country and even from abroad . Although the millions of bricks that make up its walls and ceilings were locally made in Lansing , the stone facade came from Ohio , the cast iron for the dome and floor beams from Pennsylvania , and the marble and limestone floors from Vermont . The Board of Commissioners made sure the best materials were selected for the best price -- wherever they could be found . The final cost totaled $ 1,427,738.78 , considered modest for the construction of a state capitol during this period . for much more !

Craps question here . I can see that placing 6 and 8 is a better bet than the field . The listed house edge is 1.52 percent on 6 and 8 and 2.78 percent when the field pays 3-1 on 12 , 2-1 on 2 and even money on the other numbers . But is n't the field a better bet than placing 5 or 9 ? I know guys who place 5 and 9 who would n't even think about the field . The house edge on those place bets is 4 percent , and that 's higher than the field . A. For starters , I would n't place 5 or 9 . There are better bets with lower edges . But if you 're debating a choice between placing those numbers and playing the field , there 's more than the house edge to consider . The field is a one-roll bet . You win or lose on every roll . If you want to be in action on every roll , then you must repeatedly replenish wagers . Place bets are multi-roll bets . You win if your number rolls before a 7 turns up . You lose if the shooter rolls a 7 before your number . If the roll is any other number , it does n't affect your bet . With 5 or 9 , it takes an average of 3.6 rolls to decide a place bet . With that in mind , the house edge per roll is 1.11 percent . And since the field is decided on every roll , the house edge per roll is 2.78 percent . If you had $ 5 in action on either 5 or 9 and $ 5 on the field for 360 rolls with average results , you 'd be making 360 separate wagers on the field for a total of $ 1,800 . But you 'd be making only 100 separate wagers on your field bet , for a total of $ 500 . Your average loss would be $ 50.04 on the field , but only $ 20 on the place bets despite the higher house edge . You do n't have to bet on the field on every roll . If you like it as part of a mix of bets to me made occasionally ... well , there are worse options . I would n't make field bets , and I would n't place 5 or 9 either . I like to stick with pass , come , do n't pass , do n't come , odds , and , when short-bankrolled , place bets on 6 or 8 . There are enough available options that I see no need to settle for higher house-edge wagers . Q. Do you remember the tic-tac-toe chickens ? They used to show up at different casinos for short times as promotions . If you beat the chicken , you won a big cash prize . Of course , the chickens always won or tied . Tic tac toe is an easy game and the player going first should never lose . The chickens went first and had that edge , but are they really smart enough to know the moves ? How did the chickens get so good ? A. I played against a chicken at the Tropicana in Las Vegas in the early 2000s and settled for a tie . People were lined up down a sidewalk , waiting for their chance at a $ 10,000 prize that they were n't going to win . It was good fun , though . I played a little game of staredown with the chicken , but to no avail . I asked a handler if he ever lost . She said once , several months before . My understanding is that the device the chicken pecks has a light flash with the correct move . If the chicken then pecks the right spot , it 's rewarded with a few grains of corn . Chicken feed can be a powerful incentive . Mistakes are rare .", "seg_content_paragraph_starts": "0 7 61 111 131 157 190 235 286 374 410 475 510 564 611 651 688", "simhash": "ebed79ee6e20b3396bfc25595c093cfd", "spacy_content_loc": ["Tropicana", "Las Vegas"], "spacy_content_num": ["6", "1.52 percent", "6", "2.78 percent", "3-1", "12", "2-1", "2", "5", "5", "9", "4 percent", "5", "9", "one", "7", "7", "5", "9", "3.6", "1.11 percent", "2.78 percent", "5", "5", "9 and $ 5", "360", "360", "1,800", "only 100", "500", "50.04", "only $ 20", "5", "9", "6", "8", "first", "first", "10,000"], "spacy_content_org": ["Gaming", "Q.

GRAND HAVEN -- The path connecting Grand Haven football coach Mike Farley and senior Landon VanBeek has come full circle . Now , they 're both trying to help the Buccaneers program continue to move forward . VanBeek began learning the game around the age of 9 in the `` Young Bucs '' youth organization that Farley initiated during his first run as Grand Haven 's head coach from 2006 to 2013 . Now , VanBeek is a 6-foot-4 , 230-pound college prospect , who is hoping that the COVID-19 pandemic does not wipe out his final season in a Bucs uniform . `` Honestly , everybody is in the same boat here , whether it 's just trying to play or recruiting , '' VanBeek said . The Buccaneers have encountered some rough sailing since Farley guided them to a 44-32 record with three playoff appearances and one OK Red Conference title during his previous eight-year run -LRB- 2006-13 -RRB- . After Farley left in 2014 to coach in Georgia , Grand Haven endured five-straight losing seasons and went through three other coaches . The Buccaneers did not field a junior varsity team in 2016 because of low numbers . Joe Nelson got the Bucs back on track in his third season last fall , guiding them to a 6-5 record and their first playoff berth since 2011 . Grand Haven 's 2019 team was senior-heavy . Nelson resigned this January , which opened the door for Farley 's return . On Monday , Farley was back on Gene Rothi Field -- featuring brand-new turf , by the way -- for his team 's first official practice of the 2020 season . `` It 's been great . You know , it is an adjustment , '' Farley said . `` I 've been away for six years and being able to come back and working with a whole , brand-new group of kids that were all in elementary school when I was here before , it 's been great . The kids have their worked their tails off this summer and they want to get better . '' It will be a transition , Farley noted . Grand Haven returns only one starter on defense and three on offense . New offensive -LRB- multiple spread -RRB- and defensive -LRB- 3-4 alignment -RRB- systems are being implemented . Farley estimates his varsity roster will number in the mid-40s , with 80 in the entire program . It 's learning on the fly , however , as the Buccaneers were unable to host any camps or compete in 7-on-7 events because of COVID restrictions this summer . `` I think the transition went a lot smoother than I thought it would honestly . With things up in the air , who 's going to be our coach and then COVID hitting , I thought things went great honestly , '' said VanBeek , who plays offensive line and defensive end . `` We 're still putting in a lot of stuff , mistakes are still being made , but we 're pushing forward and I think we 're in a great position . '' In addition to VanBeek , Farley is expecting big contributions from senior Grant Ellis -LRB- 6-0 , 175 -RRB- , an outside linebacker , who is the lone returning starter on defense , as well as several others . Junior Owen Worthington -LRB- 6-2 , 210 -RRB- returns to play quarterback after being elevated to the varsity team late in the 2019 season . Junior Dayne Arnett -LRB- 6-5 , 250 -RRB- will help anchor the offensive line and he 's making the defensive transition to linebacker . Farley 's also looking for plays out of the slot position from senior Tanner Williams and junior L.J. Sandoval . `` It 's strange , we do n't know what 's going to happen , but obviously we 're putting in the work as we can right now , '' said Worthington , who also will handle place-kicking duties . `` If we ca n't play , we ca n't play , but if we do the work 's going to -LRB- pay off -RRB- . '' Grand Haven finished in the middle of the pack of the always-tough OK Red Conference in 2019 , but the Buccaneers turned the corner at the midway point of the season . The Bucs were playing quite well down the stretch and they earned their first Division 1 playoff win since 2009 , knocking off Grandville 28-7 after the Bulldogs had beaten them 27-7 in the regular season . The Buccaneers ' schedule got a little tougher this season , too , with Jenison being added to the OK Red . With an additional conference contest , the Bucs had to drop their nonleague game against Grand Rapids Union . `` We 're just trying to find that right mix right now , '' Farley said . `` We 're working on skill and we 're working on trying to get ourselves to be a little bit tougher and it 's just going to be one of those things that 's going to take time . '' VanBeek is one of the players trying to set the tone in Farley 's return . VanBeek has come a long way from his days in the Young Bucs program . Now it 's his turn to lead and bring younger players along . `` That 's actually when I kind of started getting into football -LRB- was -RRB- in the Young Bucs program that -LRB- Farley -RRB- actually started , '' VanBeek said . `` He started a lot of things when I was just a little elementary kid and so it 's great to see those things are still here and we 're ready and happy to bring that tradition back .

'' That 's when she and her four daughters ran to the bathroom . `` I 've lived in Elk Grove all my life , '' Zambrano said . `` Never have I experienced something so terrifying . '' Zambrano was unable to get help after she called 911 . She then called Ramirez Snake Removal . Glen Stough , an employee with Ramirez Snake Removal , said the snake was halfway out of the toilet by the time he got to Zambrano 's home . While it did not pose a danger to the family , Stough said the snake -- which he believed was a rainbow boa -- could have killed a pet if no one noticed it was in the home . And no , it is n't common for Stough to remove snakes from toilets , he said . At the moment , no one is quite sure how the snake found itself in the Zambrano 's bathroom . Stough believes the snake 's journey could have started from another toilet from a neighboring home . The rainbow boa is not native to Elk Grove and Stough believes it was probably someone else 's pet . Usually , Stough would have relocated the snake , but because it is not from the area , it was taken to the Elk Grove Animal Shelter .

Samsung announced the support in an official blog post , that confirmed the rollout of support for HDR10 + and Samsung Smart TVs . While that 's great , it 's not entirely clear how many models will now be able to access the enhanced video content . Samsung Electronics is further expanding its HDR10 + streaming content offering with the addition of Google Play Movies to the services that support its next-generation picture-quality technology . Google Play Movies , the video streaming service operated by Google , started to support HDR10 + content in July this year . The HDR10 + service is now available on Samsung Smart TV in 117 countries including North America , Europe , and Korea . Users can now enjoy high-resolution HDR10 + 4K HDR content on the Google Play Movies , with numerous HDR10 + titles available such as Joker , Aquaman , Wonder Woman , Shazam ! , and Crazy Rich Asians . Google Play Movies plans to support HDR10 + technology on other additional platforms in the future as well . HDR10 + , which is the HDR industry-standard led by Samsung Electronics , brings consumers perfect picture quality experience by optimizing brightness and contrast scene by scene for enhanced three-dimensional videos and accurate color expression . So if you do have a Samsung Smart TV , you 'll now be able to stream some of the biggest blockbusters in the movie industry in glorious HDR10 + -- although it 's sometimes hard to distinguish just what has changed if you 're not used to the enhanced picture mode . As the announcement states , it should now be available in 117 nations worldwide , which more or less covers every single market in which Samsung operates in globally . If you have n't already , now is the time to update the Google Play Movies app on your smart TV set .

This may mark the first time that macOS users will be able to stream Netflix in 4K . Previously , streaming 4K Netflix on a computer at all required you to be on Windows and using Microsoft 's Edge browser or the Netflix Windows 10 app . That means , in theory , you could watch Netflix in 4K on a Mac via Windows in a Boot Camp partition -- but just loading up Safari , which is installed with macOS Big Sur , could be a far easier option once Big Sur is released -LRB- it 's scheduled to come out this fall -RRB- . OMG ! Netflix on macOS Big Sur 's Safari browser just gave me 4K Stream with Dolby Vision on MacBook Pro ! Earlier it was just 1080p with Dolby Vision . This is amazing . pic.twitter.com/afUQPeKisI -- Ishan Agarwal -LRB- @ishanagarwal24 -RRB- June 28 , 2020 You wo n't just need Big Sur to get the full 4K HDR experience with Netflix on Safari , though -- you may also need a more recent Mac with HDR support . Many Apple products introduced since 2018 support HDR , and you can find a full list of supported Macs on Apple 's website . You 'll also need to be subscribed to Netflix 's $ 15.99 per month Premium plan to get 4K to begin with .

Ventoy might be the tool you 're looking for and it 's quite possibly my new best friend . What is it ? Ventoy is a free and open source application that you can stick on a USB drive , which allows you to create a reusable system for booting ISO/WIM/IMG / EFI files . Instead of wiping your USB drives over and over with new distributions , Ventoy lets you just dump the files onto the drive , reboot and get an easy list of distributions to boot . It 's a tool that I 'm definitely going to be getting plenty of use from . Could end up saving quite a bit of time , all you need to do to test something out directly once setup is just dump the file onto a drive and reboot . During my own testing , it works exactly as described . However , it does n't work with everything . It does have a pretty huge set of compatible files but some do n't show up or have other issues . It 's an evolving project under constantly development and improvements , so over time more and more will be supported it with it , even so it 's a wonderful bit of software that 's worth highlighting . So next time you 're feeling a little of this , perhaps give Ventoy a try . official site here and on GitHub . Tags : Apps , Open Source 21 Likes , Who ?

Park officials have already announced the temporary suspension of cave tours and the closure of Mammoth Cave National Park 's Visitor Center . Park trails for hiking , equestrian use and bicycling remain open . Previous Reporting , March 21 : Despite a state ban on all mass gatherings , there are still ways to get outside at Mammoth Cave National Park -- even after the park this week temporarily suspended cave tours and closed its visitor center . `` Things are starting to green up . ... Spring 's a nice time to be out in the park , '' said Molly Schroer , the park 's public information officer . Wildflowers are blooming , and the birds are out in the park , she added . `` It 's a nice place to get outside , '' she said . The park Wednesday halted cave tours and closed its visitor center until further notice , following guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . `` The closures will be in place to lessen the public health risk associated with the novel coronavirus , '' a park news release said . That is n't likely to change anytime soon , especially following a joint letter issued Thursday from Kentucky Public Health Commissioner Dr. Steven Stack and acting secretary of the Cabinet for Health and Family Services Eric Friedlander . The two called for a ban on all mass gatherings . The ban extends to `` any event or convening that brings together groups of individuals , including , but not limited to , community , civic , public , leisure , faith-based or sporting events ; parades ; concerts ; festivals ; conventions ; fundraisers ; and similar activities , '' a news release said . The ban does not apply to normal operations at airports , bus and train stations , medical facilities , libraries , shopping malls and centers , `` or other spaces where persons may be in transit . '' `` It also does not include typical office environments , factories , or retail or grocery stores where large numbers of people are present but maintain appropriate social distancing , '' the release said . Still , many activities remain available at Mammoth Cave National Park , Schroer said . `` There are outdoor activities that are still accessible , '' she said . The park 's campgrounds and hiking , equestrian and bicycling trails remain open , along with restrooms immediately adjacent to the visitor center .

Granted , Wyoming has n't been hit like other states , but it was still a little nerve-wracking when we decided to load up our car and make the road trip . How safe was it ? Read on . ** Everything is subject to change after this post has gone live . We were at the park at the end of June 2020 and health and operational guidelines may change . For up-to-date operating hours , visit the Yellowstone website . Please read the CDC 's guidelines for visiting parks . Safety measures at Yellowstone The park has taken many steps to reduce the spread of COVID-19 . The one that will impact any visit is the closures of many buildings like visitor centers and inns . Places that are open , like some restaurants -LRB- for take-out only -RRB- and gift shops , encourage face masks , hand sanitizer and capacity limits . There are plenty of signs throughout the park reminding people to maintain 6 feet of social distance . I saw them at lookouts and on boardwalk trails . The popular Ranger chats were canceled while we were there , as well as most guided tours . * See the section below about which activities are n't canceled . What are the crowds like at Yellowstone ? I ca n't tell you how crowd levels compare to previous visits since this was my first time at the park . However , I had been warned about crowds , and traffic jams , and I did n't find much of that during our visit in what I had anticipated being peak summer crowd levels . The most crowded area was at Old Faithful . There were a few people wearing masks outdoors , but the majority of the crowd did not . If you wanted to maintain social distancing and still have a good view , it was quite easy to do , though . And side note : Parking at Old Faithful was not a problem , which I 'm told is unheard of in the summer . Tip : There are bathrooms near the general store at Old Faithful that will have less of a wait -LRB- or no wait -RRB- versus the bathrooms much closer to the geyser . There was n't much social distancing going on in the geyser bathroom line . Key lookouts always had a handful of people there , but it was easy to keep 6 feet apart . The only spots that were a little more difficult to maneuver around people were the boardwalks at Grand Prismatic and Mammoth Hot Springs . At least with Grand Prismatic , it was a one-way walking path . Mammoth Hot Springs had people coming and going down every path . : 7 Easy Hikes At Yellowstone National Park Which restaurants are open at Yellowstone We stayed at a cabin at Yellowstone National Park and it did n't have a kitchen nor a fire pit outside . So , we did have to get food from time to time beyond our Nutella sandwiches . Luckily , there were some grills and dining rooms open -- all for take-out , by the way . These were what were open in June 2020 : Old Faithful Cafeteria : 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. -LRB- Get your ice cream here ! -RRB- Old Faithful Lodge Bake Shop : 6:30 a.m. to 9 p.m. Old Faithful Snowlodge Geyser Grill : 6:30 a.m. to 9 p.m. Canyon Lodge Eatery : 6:30 to 10 a.m. , 11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. , and 4:30 to 9:30 p.m. Lake Lodge Wiley 's Canteen : 6:30 to 10 a.m. , 11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. , and 4:30 to 9:30 p.m. Mammoth Terrace Grill : 6:30 a.m. to 9 p.m. Grant Village Dining Room : 6:30 to 10 a.m. and 5 to 9 p.m. . It was an interesting experience getting food there . Employees all wore masks but I rarely saw guests in line with masks , even indoors . Some places , like the soda fountain at Canyon Lodge , served food to go in compostable containers . What else is open at Yellowstone right now ? As I mentioned before , gift shops were open . Most seemed to have a single entrance and a separate exit to make sure the crowd went in one direction ; though really , once you were inside , it was a free for all . Again , not a whole lot of people wearing masks , save for a handful of families , and all employees . There were masked employees standing at the entrance and exit of the Yellowstone General Store . The gift shops that were open when we visited were : Old Faithful Lodge Gift Ship Old Faithful Snow Lodge Gift Shop Lake Hotel Gift Shop Canyon Lodge Gift Shop Mammoth Hot Springs Hotel Gift Shop Along with those gift shops , you 'll find general stores open at Old Faithful , Mammoth , Canyon , Lake Area , Fishing Bridge , and Grant Village . When I was planning this trip a year ago , I had dreams of chuckwagon dinners and , who knows , maybe some twilight ranger chats . Well , most ranger chats and most activities have been canceled this summer . What IS open ? Horseback rides at Canyon Corrals Guided fishing and sightseeing charters at Bridge Bay Marina . You can also rent boats there . Rent bikes at Old Faithful Snow Lodge Gift Shop . There are two medical clinics open , though luckily , we never needed to visit one . Find the open clinics at Mammoth and Old Faithful . Where can you stay overnight at Yellowstone National Park ? I almost thought the trip I started planning in May 2019 was going to be canceled since the park delayed reopening some lodging . Luckily , the cabin we reserved in Canyon reopened a few days before our reservations . At check-in , the clerks were wearing face masks and stood behind plexiglass windows . Our room keys were plastic cards , which were handed to us in small envelopes , presumably so we never had to touch the cards , just the envelopes . Other accommodations that are open : Lake Yellowstone Cabins Lake Lodge Cabins Mammoth Hot Springs Cabins Old Faithful Lodge Cabins Old Faithful Snow Lodge Cabins Tentatively , there are plans to open up Old Faithful Inn , Old Faithful Snow Lodge , Canyon Lodge , Lake Yellowstone Hotel , and Mammoth Hot Springs Hotel later this summer . See the predicted reopen dates here . Most campgrounds are open , and many seemed to be full when we were there during the week . Reservations are highly recommended . To see which campgrounds are open and which are still closed , click here . Roads that are closed Unrelated to a pandemic , there are one road closure and construction that will affect visits in the summer of 2020 . The biggie : The road between Tower-Roosevelt to Chittenden Road is closed . That closure will probably affect any of your North Loop plans . Check out the map of the road closure to get a better idea of how it will affect your plans . There is also road construction near the North Entrance and along the Fishing Bridge to Indian Pond . Those closures did n't really cause us a traffic headache for us , at least .

Health department administrator Julie Mundell , R.N. , told The Register-Herald on Friday , `` Unfortunately , community spread is very much a concern of ours . We 're already seeing signs of that . '' Mundell said the health department is still involved in the disease investigative portion of the protocols . She said more information from the surrounding communities is also being gleaned via contact tracing , in which trained health personnel interview people who had close or prolonged interactions with an infected person . While the contact tracing proceeds , health officials are urging those who know they 've been exposed to a person who tested positive for Covid-19 to go ahead and self-quarantine . People who are awaiting a test result should also self-quarantine until being notified of a negative result . Public health officials get involved anytime a positive test for the virus is returned at a nursing home , due to the high risk of an outbreak within the facility , Mundell noted . In the current situation , an employee at the Springfield Center , a long-term care facility in Lindside , tested positive for Covid-19 early last week . Following state guidelines that set forth procedures for a potential outbreak , the nursing home immediately began facility-wide testing of residents and employees , Mundell said . Results from the first several tests came back within 24 hours ; most subsequent results have been returned in about 48 hours . The 60-bed nursing home currently has around 53 residents and 95 employees . Health department figures for the outbreak as of Saturday evening -- four days after the initial positive test was reported -- showed 51 confirmed , active cases at Springfield . Of those , 20 are employees , and 31 are residents . Four of the people diagnosed were hospitalized as of Friday . Additional test results were still pending at a laboratory at the time Mundell spoke with the newspaper . `` Everybody -LRB- employees and residents -RRB- has been tested , except for one or two employees who were off work this week , '' Mundell said Friday . `` They 're supposed to be tested today . '' Monroe Health Department 's overall Covid-19 report issued Friday evening , which included cumulative data from throughout the pandemic as well as outbreak figures , showed 74 total confirmed cases , along with one probable case . Of those cases , 58 were active , with six of those hospitalized , and 17 individuals had recovered . The county had only 20 confirmed cases prior to the outbreak . Mindful of the danger of community spread , the health department conducted a free testing event at the Monroe Health Center in Union on Saturday morning , with support from the state Department of Health and Human Resources -LRB- DHHR -RRB- . • • • Speaking at Gov. Jim Justice 's regular Friday Covid-19 press briefing , DHHR Secretary Bill Crouch mentioned the cooperation among various health agencies and the owner of Springfield Center , Stonerise Healthcare , in tackling the outbreak . Crouch confirmed that Stonerise took immediate action upon discovery of the first virus case at Springfield , testing not only all residents and staff at that facility , but also proceeding to test workers and residents at two other skilled nursing centers owned by the company in nearby Greenbrier County -- The Brier in Ronceverte and Meadow Garden in Rainelle . `` As is our standard practice , we are actively updating patients and their families , employees and other care partners as this situation evolves , '' Stonerise CEO Larry Pack said in a statement issued to media Friday evening . In addition to the Stonerise facilities , another Greenbrier County long-term care facility -- Greenbrier Health Care Center -- announced on social media Friday that it was testing all patients and employees . That round of testing was prompted by the discovery that a medical professional who had provided care to the facility 's patients the previous week had subsequently tested positive for the virus . As of the Saturday night health department report , there had not been the kind of substantial movement in Greenbrier County cases that would indicate an outbreak had yet been detected there . According to daily health department reports on social media , the county had seen five new Covid-19 cases in the past week , with no more than one new case on any given day . Crouch said Greenbrier health officer Dr. Bridgett Morrison personally traveled to Monroe County to assist in handling the Springfield crisis Friday , while members of the West Virginia National Guard stood ready to transport supplies , as needed . • • • The impact of the outbreak quickly was seen around Monroe County as all athletic practices were canceled by the school board and the county courthouse was ordered to be closed to the public until further notice . An announcement of the courthouse closure , issued by the county commission on Thursday , indicated that all county offices would continue to be staffed during normal business hours -- 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday . People with business to transact with the county should call the appropriate office to ascertain if the transaction can be performed by telephone , mail , online or email .

Two more EMS staffers have tested positive since Saturday , bringing the total to eight . Adams learned of the first case in his department on Tuesday or Wednesday , he said . Speaking over video stream to the in-person Riley County commission Monday , Adams said he had been made aware of three new cases in his department Friday afternoon , less than an hour before he had been scheduled to appear on the 4:15 p.m. COVID-19 press conference . That was different than what he told The Mercury Saturday evening ; he said then he had been made aware of those cases `` about this time Friday . '' The Mercury reported the first six positive cases in EMS in Sunday 's edition . Adams spoke during the press conference , answering a question about ambulance sanitation practices , but did n't mention the outbreak . It was not clear who had asked the question . No one came to work sick , Adams said , and the department has tested 25 employees , with two or three tests still pending . The department is also contact-tracing anyone who may have come in contact with one of two staffers with whom the virus originated in the department . He said the department followed its COVID-19 plan , which it developed with the Riley County Health Department , `` to a T. '' `` We think we have a pretty good handle on it now , '' he said . Adams ' presence at the press conference was unusual . He said he had been scheduled to appear on the Friday afternoon press conference since Wednesday , and he decided not to reveal the cases then since he did n't have many details . The Mercury broke the story of the department 's COVID-19 cases on Sunday morning , and the Riley County emergency operations center later released more details on the cases that afternoon . In hindsight , Adams said he recognizes he could have maybe released information Friday . `` Please , I mean this when I say this was n't a conspiracy , '' Adams said . But Adams was later rebuffed by KayLee Proctor , a former EMS worker and wife to a current employee . Speaking during the public comment portion of the meeting , Proctor accused Adams of lying and said that her husband and other department staff members knew that at least five employees were infected with coronavirus on Thursday . `` I knew about it on Thursday , and so did he , '' she said . `` So which is it ? Did you take precautions and still spread the virus to other employees or did you try to cover this up ? Or are you expecting the public to be held to a higher standard than yourself ? '' Other public comment speakers , including commission candidate Fanny Fang and local Black Lives Matter leader Theresa Parks , also lashed out at the commission for what they called the commission 's inaction and silence on recent issues like requiring masks and racism . Commission chairman Marvin Rodriguez said that while he felt the speakers ' frustrations , he did not believe the commission could constitutionally require the public to wear masks in public . Commissioner John Ford said he was extremely concerned after hearing about some race-related incidents , including a K-State student 's post on Twitter that drew backlash from K-State athletes . He said he personally wanted to be more proactive on those kinds of discussions . In other business Riley County Police Department Capt. Josh Kyle presented the commission with its updated proposal for a $ 444,000 Aggieville substation . RCPD officials are looking to relocate their existing substation into the $ 14 million parking garage the Manhattan city government is building south of Rally House . Kyle said the department 's existing space in the business district , which it has used since 1993 , no longer adequately meets police needs for a high traffic area like Aggieville . He said officers need more space to hold private interviews and evidence , as well as a more secure location that could protect the station from gunfire . The proposal would create a 4,100 square foot substation at the parking garage 's ground level . Additionally , Kyle said RCPD is looking to build a $ 222,000 adjacent training room . The department 's existing training room at the police headquarters no longer fits the department 's size . By creating an Aggieville training room , the department could vacate the existing room and expand the communications center . The county would pay the city for the cost of constructing the space over the life of the parking garage 's 20 years of debt service , and assistant city manager Jason Hilgers estimated that the county would pay roughly $ 50,000 over the 20 years to repay the city 's costs of building the substation . Commissioners were hesitant to immediately approve the project and instructed county staff and Hilgers to develop more specific details on those costs . The commission approved a request to increase the solid waste transfer station 's fees to $ 55 per ton , with a minimum charge of $ 13.75 , starting Sept. 1 . That 's up from $ 50 per ton and a minimum charge of $ 12.50 . Tire disposal prices will also increase to $ 4 per small tire , $ 8 for medium tires and $ 17 for large tires , with an added $ 5 fee if the tires are still mounted . Assistant county engineer Gary Rosewicz said the county 's commercial waste processors indicated they prefer larger increases every few years rather than steady increases annually . County clerk Rich Vargo said he 's encouraging the public to continue filling out and completing advance ballot applications , of which the county has already received over 5,000 . The county will send start sending those ballots out by mail on July 15 , which is also when in-person advance voting starts . Vargo said he 's trying to find a replacement polling site for the Manhattan Fire Department on Denison , since the fire department estimates it will continue needing it for the county 's COVID-19 emergency operations center . The fire department site is a prominent polling location , and while Vargo said he might be able to relocate voters to other nearby sites , he encouraged members of the public to vote by mail instead .", "seg_content_paragraph_starts": "0 36 52 117 162 184 194 270 287 363 378 397 455 516 560 591 636 639 687 748 765 819 876 899 985 1011 1065 1103", "simhash": "65942d4e4271a800dea4f614735748e6", "spacy_content_loc": ["Riley County", "Riley County", "Manhattan", "Aggieville", "Aggieville"], "spacy_content_num": ["Two", "eight", "first", "three", "first", "six", "25", "two", "three", "one", "two", "at least five", "444,000", "$ 14 million", "a 4,100 square foot", "222,000", "roughly $ 50,000"], "spacy_content_org": ["EMS", "EMS", "Mercury", "Mercury", "EMS", "the Riley County Health Department", "Mercury", "EMS", "Twitter", "Riley County", "Aggieville", "RCPD", "Rally House", "Hilgers"], "spacy_content_otr": [], "spacy_content_per": ["Riley County", "David Adams", "Adams", "Adams", "Adams", "Adams", "Adams", "Adams", "Adams", "Adams", "KayLee Proctor", "Proctor", "Adams", "Fanny Fang", "Theresa Parks", "Marvin Rodriguez", "John Ford", "Josh Kyle", "Kyle", "Kyle", "RCPD", "Jason Hilgers"], "spacy_content_tim": ["Monday", "morning", "Friday", "Saturday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Monday", "Friday", "afternoon", "less than an hour", "4:15 p.m.", "Saturday", "evening", "Friday", "Sunday", "Friday", "afternoon", "Wednesday", "Sunday morning", "afternoon", "Friday", "Thursday", "Thursday", "1993", "20 years", "the 20 years"], "spacy_title_loc": [], "spacy_title_num": [], "spacy_title_org": ["EMS"], "spacy_title_otr": [], "spacy_title_per": [], "spacy_title_tim": [], "text_category": {}, "title_c_count": 17, "tpc_m": {"t580": 0.1440846174955368, "t421": 0.10833151638507843}, "url": "https://themercury.com/news/ems-director-decision-to-withhold-news-on-positive-cases-in-department-not-a-conspiracy/article_e9702470-d942-51d7-a113-95e4e8dd9dcb.html"}

The Indiana Health Care Association -LRB- IHCA -RRB- / Indiana Center for Assisted Living -LRB- INCAL -RRB- President Zach Cattell said IHCA and INCAL support a current law in the state regarding immunity . IHCA/INCAL `` is aware of the existing Indiana statute regarding immunity from civil liability for the provision of professional health care services by licensed health care providers during a declared disaster emergency , '' Cattell told The Center Square . `` It is important to note that the statute is not blanket immunity and any health care provider is still liable for gross negligence or willful misconduct . '' Cattell said the origins of the law were unknown to the agencies . `` Though we are not aware of the specific circumstances that led the legislature to pass this law more than a decade ago , we support the existing law as it provides basic assurances to health care providers that their reasonable actions to provide patient care in response to the disaster emergency may be protected , '' Cattell said . The Herald Bulletin reported that there are currently more than 20 states that have passed laws or executive orders providing immunity to nursing homes and long-term care facilities from COVID-19-related lawsuits . In April , Indiana clarified its own law providing immunity aside from gross negligence and willful misconduct .

John Hale , a consultant and advocate for Iowa seniors , said , `` If we were in court making a case for why immunity bills like Senate File 2338 are horrible ideas , the Iowa Department of Inspections and Appeals ' findings at Dubuque Specialty Care would be our Exhibit A. '' Eleven residents of Dubuque Specialty Care have died of COVID-19 , according to the state , and 43 residents of the home have been infected . The home currently has about 48 residents . According to the Department of Inspections and Appeals , inspectors visited the home the first week of June . In addition to finding that three symptomatic employees had been working in the home shortly before testing positive for COVID-19 , the inspectors observed employees working without personal protective equipment , the Iowa Capital Dispatch reported . A bill that was approved by legislators and the governor shortly after that inspection took place includes an `` actual injury requirement '' for lawsuits tied to COVID-19 exposure . It states that a person can sue for COVID-19 exposure only if one or more of the following criteria are met : The lawsuit must involve an act that was `` intended to cause harm , '' or involve an act that `` constitutes actual malice , '' or involve in-patient hospitalization or death . The first two criteria set a standard of deliberate and potentially criminal conduct that critics of the legislation say would very likely prove difficult for any resident or their family to meet . The third criteria could pose a hurdle if the nursing home -- for whatever reason -- did n't refer a sick resident to a hospital , or the resident 's death was attributed to underlying issues despite a COVID-19 diagnosis . Even if one of the three criteria were met , the new law also provides that nursing homes can not be held liable for damages related to COVID-19 exposure unless the owners or managers have been shown to `` recklessly disregard a substantial and unnecessary risk '' related to COVID-19 exposure . The last hurdle to litigation may be the biggest , and it existed before the pandemic : Nursing homes often include arbitration clauses in their admissions contracts with residents , prohibiting families from suing them in court . At one time , the federal government prohibited those clauses , but that policy was overturned last year . Iowa is now one of at least 21 states that have limited the liability of health care providers in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic , with nine of those states specifically including nursing homes in their legislation . On June 16 , Republicans in the Iowa House and Senate approved the immunity bill on largely party-line votes . Reynolds signed the bill into law on June 18 . That was two weeks after state inspectors uncovered evidence that Dubuque Specialty Care , which is owned by one of Iowa 's largest nursing home corporations , had allowed employees to work there while exhibiting symptoms of the virus . All three later tested positive for COVID-19 . The Iowa Association of Area Agencies on Aging , which represents federally funded , regional organizations that assist more than half a million older Iowans with meals and other services , wrote to Reynolds and voiced concerns over her decision to sign the immunity bill into law . By taking that action , the agencies said , the governor `` severely reduced the protections of Iowa 's most vulnerable older adults . '' The agencies said they were `` in agreement with numerous other advocates for older adults , individuals with disabilities , and caregivers , in our deep discouragement in failing to protect older Iowans who are in long-term care . '' AARP Iowa wrote to Reynolds on June 4 , before the legislation had been approved by lawmakers , saying it `` strongly opposed '' any effort to curtail the legal rights of Iowa 's nursing home residents . The association told the governor that Iowans already faced `` many significant barriers to accessing the courts '' with their complaints about nursing home care . -LSB- Read more from the Iowa Capital Dispatch -RSB- `` Iowa should not strip away the rights and protections of residents , '' AARP Iowa wrote . `` Nursing homes and other long-term care facilities should know they will continue to be held responsible for providing the level of quality care that is required of them , and for which they are being compensated . This also incentivizes facilities to self-correct by addressing problems to improve care . '' Brent Willett , president and CEO of the Iowa nursing home industry 's lobbying organization , the Iowa Health Care Association , said the organization `` applauds the actions of the Iowa House and Senate '' and added that the new law will `` help ensure Iowans have continued access to long-term care services and support '' during the pandemic . `` This legislation contains a number of important provisions designed to deter frivolous lawsuits against health care providers who are following recommended guidance to care for their patients during this health care crisis , while also providing families a legal recourse in cases of recklessness or intentional harm that cause hospitalization or death , '' Willett said . `` These protections are important because the potentially exorbitant legal fees and costs to defend against baseless lawsuits deplete critical resources needed to care for our state 's elderly during this challenging time . '' In Congress , Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky. , has adopted that same kind of language in advocating for federal legislation to shield nursing homes and other medical providers from COVID-19 lawsuits . `` We are not going to let health care heroes emerge from this crisis facing a tidal wave of medical malpractice lawsuits so that trial lawyers can line their pockets , '' McConnell told the Senate . That same reasoning was used by Republican state lawmakers in pushing Iowa 's immunity bill through the House and Senate , which they said would protect health care workers throughout the state . House Speaker Pat Grassley , R-New Hartford , stated that Iowa caregivers `` should be protected for their heroism , selflessness , and for doing the right thing during an unprecedented and rapidly evolving situation . That 's what our COVID liability legislation is about . '' The Iowa law grants immunity not just to licensed health care professionals , but also to the `` the person who possesses or is in control of '' a health care facility . Hale says Dubuque Specialty Care `` failed to have acceptable infection prevention and control procedures in place , yet immunity bills like SF 2338 in Iowa and a host of similar bills in other states -- and in Congress -- would issue them a pass .

As the number of cases of COVID-19 continue to increase , so does the demand for convalescent plasma . There has been a drop in donations over the past few weeks . Now is a critical time for those who have recovered from the infection to donate and support COVID patients in need . The donation process for COVID-19 convalescent plasma is the same as with other plasma donations and is performed using an apheresis machine , which separates the blood components . The convalescent plasma donations take about 30-40 minutes and are collected at Versiti donor centers . For more information , visit www.versiti.org/ways-to-give/our-communities/illinois . The plasma treatment transfers the antibodies that the recovered patient created into critically ill patients currently receiving care . Because of the investigational nature of this treatment , it is difficult to predict how many plasma infusions a COVID-19 patient may require . In addition to severely affected patients , this treatment is also being used in patients earlier in their illness in an attempt to limit progression of the virus ' effects .

Some leagues , like the National Basketball Association -LRB- NBA -RRB- have had success with preventing the virus , primarily by keeping players in a ` bubble ' that isolates them from other parties . Others , like Major League Baseball -LRB- MLB -RRB- , have had interruptions in their already-shortened seasons as players test positive and games are delayed due to team outbreaks . TODAY spoke to medical experts about what particular vulnerabilities sports teams have , what methods work best to control the virus , and whether schools and local teams can have a season while containing the virus . Can isolating players slow the spread of COVID-19 ? According to some experts , the success of the NBA in preventing infections is proof that the ` bubble ' method works . As described in a 113-page manual , players are quarantined on a Disney World campus , where they ca n't leave without permission . Masks are required except when playing basketball , eating food or going outside . Players can only interact with those inside the bubble , and those who leave are penalized . Dr. Amesh Adalja , a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and an infectious disease physician , told TODAY that the bubble system can help since it removes players from the community . `` We 're trying to play these sports during a pandemic when many parts of the country are not under control , not because of the sport , but because of community spread . Unless you can isolate your players , you 're going to see outbreaks -LRB- on teams -RRB- , '' he said . `` Players are n't robots , they live in the community as well . Whatever 's going on in the community will have an impact on your sports team . '' While the bubbles may be an effective method , they 're certainly not an option for all athletes . `` You ca n't put Little League or college students in a bubble in the way that professional leagues can , '' Adalja said . Recently , students returning to campus for sports have tested positive after going to parties or other social events . Justin Lessler , Ph.D. , an associate professor of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore , said that the spread was helped by the fact that teams spend a lot of time together . While the nature of most sports requires close contact , he said keeping teams isolated can help slow the spread of the virus . Whatever 's going on in the community will have an impact on your sports team . Dr. Amesh Adalja `` We know that most transmission happens in situations with very close extended contact , like households , '' he explained . `` There are other places where transmission happens , but those situations are the places really driving the underlying epidemic . Things like locker rooms are places of closeness , and I suspect that 's the big driver of the disease . '' How important is community spread ? Experts warn that the greatest hurdle most teams face is community spread . Unless teams bubble , like the NBA , the players will be going in and out of their local community , and that may lead to viral spread . `` Team sports seem like a place where it 's particularly hard to control the spread , '' said Lessler . `` I 'm thinking less about the risk to the players , though that is there ... I think if kids are coming home from their team sports to a household where there 's an older grandparent or someone with a health condition , they could be putting that person at a lot of risk even if they themselves do n't have symptoms . '' Lessler cautioned that sports should really only happen if community transmission is low . `` This is a high-risk activity , and we should be very careful in how we proceed , and really only do it if community caseloads are very low , '' he said . Can testing help get teams playing again ? Testing is an essential part of returning to daily life , according to experts , but flaws in the system -- like long wait times , faulty tests , and accessibility issues -- means that many small sports teams are n't able to rely on them . `` Access to testing is critical , but I do n't think it solves the problem , '' said Lessler , citing concerns like slow results and false negatives . `` Testing is one of the most critical parts of our controlled strategy , I think depending on it alone , given the current tests available , to prevent outbreaks and spread among sports teams is not viable . '' Some leagues , like the MLB , have relied on testing , but Dr. Yvonne Maldonado , a professor of pediatrics -LRB- infectious diseases -RRB- and health research and policy at Stanford Health Care , questioned that approach . `` Testing does n't keep you from being infected , it just tells you who 's infected , '' she said . Again , experts warned that this method likely is n't possible for local teams or school leagues , who do n't have the funds and resources that professional leagues have . How can teams limit viral spread on the field ? Even with testing and other preventative measures , it 's possible that athletes could spread the virus to each other while engaging in play . Some sports , like tennis or baseball , might not have much to worry about here , but contact sports like football or hockey could be higher-risk . `` Players will have a lot of contact , '' said Maldonado . `` Sports are going to have to adapt ... -LRB- Teams -RRB- have to test ahead of time , only let players go out if they are negative , and keep hands away from their faces while playing . '' As much as on the field behavior matters , Maldonado said the real risk is `` off the field '' where players are engaging with the community . For teams that do n't have the funds to test or quarantine players , she advises they stick towards more distanced or low-contact sports like baseball or tennis . `` There are going to be a lot of kids who are disappointed this year , -LRB- but -RRB- playing is very dependent on the amount of resources , '' she said . `` I do n't think schools have figured out how to be back in school , let alone have sports in the mix .

So are the NFL 's Miami Dolphins and Philadelphia Eagles . The COVID-19 pandemic shut down sports in mid-March . Now , leagues are slowly returning ; NASCAR and the PGA Tour have held events , and major league baseball and the NBA plan to start up next month . College and pro football aim to begin on time . A prime example of how COVID-19 has and will change the fan experience : Texas Motor Speedway sent a form to ticket holders for the July 19 NASCAR race that outlines protocols -LRB- temperature check , health questionnaire , masks encouraged -RRB- and requires a waiver that fans acknowledge the risk of contracting the coronavirus by attending the race . The NBA 's and MLB 's plans to resume initially do n't include fans in the stands . The NFL and college football are still wrestling with whether their seasons this fall can include fans at stadiums and to what extent social distancing would limit that . Carolina Panthers owner David Tepper said on CNBC in May that he anticipates at least some fans at Bank of America Stadium this season . `` You wo n't be having full stadiums . but that does n't mean you ca n't have some fans in the stadium , either , '' he said . The Panthers declined an interview request on the topic of fans returning to games , saying their plan is still being formulated . The NFL intends to tarp off the rows closest to the field in each stadium to create additional distance between fans and players . The Observer interviewed several Charlotte sports executives and hygiene expert Olinger on what it will take for fans to feel comfortable returning to games . The consensus : This is about detailed change , but it 's also about showing the public in a prominent way that safety from infection is the top concern . As states slowly phase out stay-at-home orders , it 's imperative that teams and leagues address the inhibitions many fans will feel about returning to large gatherings . As Dan Rajkowski , chief operating officer of minor league baseball 's Charlotte Knights , said , `` Going to the grocery store is a necessity . Going to the ballpark is not a necessity . '' As most sports take their first tentative steps toward staging events , NASCAR 's top series has already held 10 races over the past month , including one at Talladega Superspeedway that had about 5,000 fans in the stands . The All-Star Race on July 15 , moved to Bristol , Tenn. , from Charlotte Motor Speedway , will allow up to 30,000 . What has NASCAR learned that other sports can emulate ? `` It 's not that hard , '' Charlotte Motor Speedway Executive Vice President Greg Walter said . `` We are overthinking it . It 's common sense . It 's attention to detail . But it 's really not that hard . '' Walter 's point : While every procedure -- from how fans enter and leave a stadium to where they sit to how they use bathrooms or get food and beverages -- must be reviewed , changing procedures is n't insurmountably complex . It 's satisfying customers ' concerns , scrutinizing practices and showing a commitment to avoid getting people sick . Walter -- in his 20th year with Speedway Motorsports , which runs Charlotte , Bristol , Texas and five other racetracks -- said sports faced a similar challenge after the Sept. 11 attacks . `` There were lots of visual cues that we had to give our guests to make them feel safe : enhanced security , bag checks , the presence of tactical teams , '' Walter said . `` When fans begin to come back , those same kind of visual cues are going to have to exist . Is the venue -- this entertainment opportunity -- taking my health seriously ? '' Walter said it 's now imperative , for instance , to make sure soap dispensers are n't empty on race weekends . Other changes are more complicated , like how to avoid making 500 people stand shoulder-to-shoulder waiting for a parking tram after a race . Some traditional amenities -- such as pit passes allowing fans to mingle with race teams in the infield -- are n't practical right now . Walter mentioned that one of the most popular aspects of pro sports , premium seating , must be rethought : The buffets that are typical for club seating at a game or race , or the hospitality tents at golf tournaments , will be problematic . That sort of party does n't work in a time of social distancing . Ticketing -- figuring out who can sit where , and how close to whom -- becomes a Rubik 's Cube problem , where a maximum 50 % capacity might in practice be closer to 30 % . `` If I have a family of two , then a family of four , then a group of 10 , that 10 can be together , that two can be together , that four can be together . But by the time I space them out -LRB- 6 feet of distance between groups -RRB- , that may be 30 % , '' Walter explained .", "seg_content_paragraph_starts": "0 21 68 85 127 170 232 281 341 388 413 443 490 545 610 674 684 728 789 823 859 894 965 1025 1062", "simhash": "92f4b96fd93128895788e35f1efcc66b", "spacy_content_loc": ["Charlotte", "Philadelphia Eagles", "Charlotte", "Bristol", "Tenn.", "Charlotte", "Bristol", "Texas"], "spacy_content_num": ["first", "10", "one", "about 5,000", "30,000", "five", "500"], "spacy_content_org": ["the Global Biorisk Advisory Council", "Olinger", "Spectrum Center", "the Charlotte Hornets", "NFL", "Miami Dolphins", "NASCAR", "the PGA Tour", "NBA", "Texas Motor Speedway", "NASCAR", "NBA", "MLB", "NFL", "Carolina Panthers", "CNBC", "Bank of America Stadium", "Panthers", "NFL", "minor league baseball 's", "NASCAR", "Talladega", "Charlotte Motor Speedway", "NASCAR", "Charlotte Motor Speedway", "Speedway Motorsports"], "spacy_content_otr": ["Once", "` Going", "Superspeedway"], "spacy_content_per": ["Patty Olinger", "David Tepper", "Olinger", "Dan Rajkowski", "Charlotte Knights", "Greg Walter", "Walter", "Walter", "Walter", "Walter"], "spacy_content_tim": ["mid-March", "next month", "July 19", "seasons this fall", "May", "this season", "the past month", "July 15", "his 20th year", "Sept. 11", "weekends"], "spacy_title_loc": [], "spacy_title_num": ["first"], "spacy_title_org": [], "spacy_title_otr": [], "spacy_title_per": [], "spacy_title_tim": [], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"Sports": 1.0000100135803223}, "second_cat": {"Sports_Other": 1.0000100135803223}}, "title_c_count": 17, "tpc_m": {"t971": 0.10412828624248505, "t178": 0.18591301143169403}, "url": "https://www.statesman.com/sports/20200629/how-will-sports-teams-persuade-fans-to-risk-covid-19-exposure-to-come-to-games-masks-first"}

'' Myers is a Houston teacher who is also an rising Houston entrepreneur with her own branding company called , Seaux Savvy . She collaborated with Houston developer , Chris Senegal to host a seminar on June 11 called `` Buy the Block , '' to help other entrepreneurs invest in the Fifth Ward revitalization . `` I was impressed that Chris was able to acquire this land , turn it into opportunities for homeowners , and also maintain the integrity the neighborhood , '' Myers said . Myers said she had success with Cocoa Collective Exchange since her first virtual marketplace in May . `` I just want to have this be a community where people can come and get everything they need in one place , '' Myers said . `` It just took off from there and started developing into a larger community . '' The death of George P. Floyd has inspired Myers to work on social reform . `` He was one of the contributing factors in some of the platforms I came up with . Because of COVID-19 , it gave us some time to stop and do something . Just changing your profile picture and getting a sign is not enough . We need to be intentional about bringing about real change . We need a real game-plan . '' Myers urges Houstonians to participate in social change and wants to do her part to inspire . She 's dedicating one seminar to fighting for social justice in America on July 5 at 10 a.m. `` You 're saying ` the land of the free and home of the brave , ' there needs to be equity and fairness across the board , '' Myers said . `` I want people to leave feeling empowered , ready to take action and bring about positive and real change .

To share your own memory of Dean Frumkin , please send it to -LSB- email protected -RSB- . Jay Baker , Philanthropist Patty and I have had an incredible relationship with Dean Steven Frumkin from our time working with him at FIT . As dean , he accomplished many things at FIT . Two that were very special for Patty and me was getting the Jay and Patty Baker School of Business accredited , and for also keeping the Baker Scholars program very up to date . Most of all , we will miss his friendship and his terrific warmth whenever we met him . We will miss him very much . Dr. Joyce F. Brown , President , FIT With Dean Frumkin 's passing , we have lost a most valuable member of our community . Through his leadership , he not only earned the trust , affection , and respect of faculty , staff , and students , but also shaped the future of his school . Deborah Beard , Associate Professor and Associate Chair of Technical Design I remember Steven always willing to help everyone . He kept humor in everything . Worked hard on accreditation . Charles Flug , Adjunct Assistant Professor , Fashion Business Management There is little I can say that has not already been said but I would like to relate to you my first meeting with him . I was called up to his office as part of the CCE process . He looked over the student comments and then said your students seem to really like your style . You must be an easy grader . He then asked which firm I began my career with . I replied Montgomery Ward he then replied `` out of business . '' I then mentioned Charming Shoppe . He replied `` out of business . '' I mentioned Frederick Atkins and he replied `` out of business . Flug , it seems you have done a good job of putting people out of business . '' I asked him where he started and he told me , to which I replied `` out of business . '' He then mentioned a few mills that he worked for , to which I replied `` out of business . '' We looked at each for a moment and he began laughing and I started laughing . His last comment to me was some industry we chose to work in . Robin Sackin Litwinsky , assistant professor and chair , Fashion Business Management When I was traveling a few years back , Steven told me to give my girls his number in case of an emergency when I was away . They never used it when I was away ... but ... one day I was in Steven 's office and his cell phone rings and he answers it ... it is his personal phone so I start to leave . He motions for me to stay . So I do . I am listening to his conversation and he is saying things like how are you doing ? What 's going on ? How can I help you ? Yes , men can be jerks , etc. . So I thought it was his daughter calling . But about three minutes into the conversation I get up to leave again and I hear him say ... oh she 's right here and hands me the phone ... It is -LSB- my daughter -RSB- Dina ! I am saying to her why are you calling Steven ... She says , I tried to get you but you were not answering ... Steven told me I could always call him . And what is she calling about ? She had a fight with her boyfriend . I thought of this story today and it made me smile . Robert Norman , Adjunct Assistant Professor , Fashion Business Management We talked about everything from industry related topics to family . His stories always made me chuckle . He would call me sometimes just to hear my thoughts on some new fashion technology he heard about . Asking `` do you think this is going to big or just a fad . '' Lol . . I felt a kinship with him and it hurts to know I did n't get to have one last lunch with him . Taur Orange , director , Office of Educational Opportunity Programs Utterly heartbreaking . Witty , real , savvy , approachable ... what a loss for us . Melissa Perilli , adjunct assistant professor , Fashion Business Management I had the chance to meet Dean Frumkin when I was going up for my CCE . We spent the whole meeting laughing about E.J. 's the sock company he worked for many years ago . He was quite a character and so very important to FIT . Jean Marc Rejaud , assistant chair , Advertising and Marketing Communications Steven was always recognizing achievements by his team members ... never taking credit for himself but sincerely believing in the recognition of his team members as the drive to succeed . His sense of humor was legendary . Numerous times at meetings he would be listening to me on a presentation and , at the end , he would ask me to do it again but in English this time . Steven 's analogies were colorful . He used the analogy of the frog and the boiling water to explain that small change increments enable a project to , in the end , fully succeed , as such small increments do not generate hard push backs to changes ... just to increase the temperature of a bowl of water with a frog into the bowl will make that the frog stays even though the temperature increases . Steven was very clever and knew how to navigate an organization to still pursue some high profile / change-focused projects like the B&T accreditation project -LRB- and others -RRB- . Steven was a caring person . When I lost my mother at the beginning of the year , he sent me emails and texts telling me that I had friends at FIT , and when I came back from France after the funerals , he hugged me . That tells it all . Steven is a person that I will keep in mind and my heart for the rest of my life . Someone that I will continue to look at for insights and guidance for my personal and professional projects ... . `` What would Steven have said or done ?

Marshall died on Thursday , June 25 , at a local care center in Temple . He was 83 years old . `` As the choral music department supervisor and high school choral director for Temple Independent School District , he grew the choral music department to what is in place today , including his love for a small group of singers , which he called the Polyfoniks , '' according to Marshall 's obituary . Temple ISD Superintendent Bobby Ott emphasized how the Polyfoniks will have a lasting impact on the local community . `` The mark that he has left on the school system is timeless , and he has absolutely left an impression that will last forever . It 's a fine arts program that 's not just known regionally , but around the state , '' Ott said . `` Without his vision it would n't exist . '' Ott said the Polyfoniks -- a group , which he called `` forward thinking '' -- will outlast his time in TISD . `` There 's not too many times that I go places , and somebody does n't tell me they were in the Polyfoniks , '' he said . `` They could be 40 , 50 , 30 or 20 ... They 'll come up to me and say they were in the Polyfoniks . It 'll outlast all of us . '' Marshall was born on Nov. 21 , 1936 , in Frederick , Okla. , to Ed and LuCele Marshall . He attended and graduated from Temple High where he was an active member of the school 's band and the Highlighters -- Temple High 's jazz band . Marshall 's passion for music exceeded his tenure as a Temple High student , as he enrolled into Baylor University in pursuit of a bachelor 's degree in music . He graduated from the program in 1958 , and met his wife , the former Bobbie Skinner , that same year . The pair relocated from Central Texas to Frederick , where he began sharing his musical knowledge as a teacher . But Marshall was eager to enhance his musical prowess and returned to Waco for a master 's degree in music , which he completed in 1964 . Marshall and his family moved to Texas City to continue his teaching career before moving back to Temple , where he cultivated a new era of musicians for 24 years before retiring . But Marshall 's musical legacy was not limited to just the school districts he taught in , as he was a music minister at churches in each town he taught in . Memorial Baptist Church in Temple was the last church he served . Marshall is survived by his wife of 61 years , Bobbie Marshall ; their daughter , Sharon Kelley and her husband David ; granddaughter , Melanie Collier and her husband Jason ; and three great-grandchildren . Scanio-Harper Funeral Home will hold a service for Marshall at 2 p.m. today . He will be buried at Hillcrest Cemetery .", "seg_content_paragraph_starts": "0 26 48 102 121 179 202 312 364 411 444 488 524", "simhash": "db0f127ea12f50253f48bd064f2c42f1", "spacy_content_loc": ["Polyfoniks", "Temple", "Polyfoniks", "Polyfoniks", "Polyfoniks", "Polyfoniks", "Frederick", "Okla.", "Temple High", "Temple High", "Central Texas", "Frederick", "Waco", "Texas City", "Temple", "Temple", "Hillcrest Cemetery"], "spacy_content_num": ["40", "20", "three"], "spacy_content_org": ["Temple High 's", "Temple Independent School District", "the choral music department", "Temple ISD", "Ott", "Polyfoniks", "TISD", "Baylor University", "Memorial Baptist Church"], "spacy_content_otr": [], "spacy_content_per": ["Dwain Marshall", "Marshall", "Marshall", "Bobby Ott", "Ott", "Marshall", "Ed", "LuCele Marshall", "Marshall", "Bobbie Skinner", "Marshall", "Marshall", "Marshall", "Marshall", "Bobbie Marshall", "Sharon Kelley", "David", "Melanie Collier", "Jason", "Scanio-Harper Funeral Home", "Marshall"], "spacy_content_tim": ["2 p.m.", "today", "Thursday , June 25", "83 years old", "today", "50", "30", "Nov. 21 , 1936", "1958", "same year", "1964", "24 years", "61 years", "2 p.m.", "today"], "spacy_title_loc": [], "spacy_title_num": [], "spacy_title_org": [], "spacy_title_otr": [], "spacy_title_per": [], "spacy_title_tim": [], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"Obituary": 0.9442667961120605, "ArtsEntertainment": 0.5829603672027588}, "second_cat": {"ArtsEntertainment_Music": 0.5829603672027588}, "third_cat": {"ArtsEntertainment_Music_Other": 0.5829603672027588}}, "title_c_count": 7, "tpc_m": {"t822": 0.13187912106513977}, "url": "https://www.tdtnews.com/news/central_texas_news/article_57af9886-ba60-11ea-809a-2b47aaf5deb4.html"}

There has been criticism , yes , but mainly kudos for the Seahawks coach and general manager for their upkeep of the franchise . No NFC team has been as consistent as the Seahawks since they started running the franchise 10 years ago . Playoffs eight of the past 10 seasons . Two Super Bowl appearances and one win . It 's hard to beat that . Except one guy has . -LRB- Cue the Imperial March music -RRB- . Patriots coach/GM Bill Belichick . If the top minds in football are a group of Himalayas , Belichick is the Everest . And him signing former league MVP Cam Newton to a one-year deal for a bit more than $ 1 million -LRB- though he could earn up to $ 7.5 million if he hits all his incentives -RRB- , may rank among his shrewdest moves yet . After Tom Brady departed to Tampa Bay , questions abounded whether New England would have the personnel necessary to compete for another Super Bowl title . And with Newton , who played his first nine seasons with the Panthers , those odds just skyrocketed , no ? True , the former No. 1 overall pick has been hampered by foot injuries that caused him to miss 16 games over the past two seasons . There have been multiple shoulder surgeries throughout his career as well . But there are people such as former league MVP Kurt Warner , who shined with the Rams , then later signed with the Cardinals after enduring his own injuries , who thinks Newton can emulate his second act . `` I was able to return to form , playing at a Pro Bowl level and reaching the Super Bowl once more , '' Warner wrote on NFL.com . `` Knowing Cam 's track record and the competitor that lies within him , I would not be surprised if he once again rose to the top of the league . '' But this is less about Newton as it is about Belichick , whose long and short-term moves have netted the Patriots six Super Bowl wins , nine Super Bowl appearances and a record of 237-83 over the past 20 seasons . This is the guy who drafted Brady in the sixth round and decided to keep riding him once Drew Bledsoe got healthy . This is the guy who traded a fourth-round pick to the Raiders for Randy Moss in 2007 , when Moss caught a record 23 touchdown passes and the Pats went 16-0 . He picked one-time Super Bowl MVP Julian Edelman in the seventh round , knowing he would n't play his college position of quarterback . He signed cornerback Darrelle Revis to a one-year deal the year New England beat the Seahawks in the Super Bowl . He makes move after move that keeps the Pats in the championship hunt every year , and last year , provided them with the top-ranked defense in the league . Like I said before , Carroll and Schneider deserve all the acclaim they 've received . Drafting the likes of Russell Wilson , Earl Thomas , Richard Sherman , Kam Chancellor and Bobby Wagner , among many others , is a permanent gold star on their resumes . Beefing up their roster with players such as Marshawn Lynch , Jadeveon Clowney or Duane Brown is equally noteworthy . Masterful as Carroll may be as a coach , particularly on the defensive end , the personnel moves have been what 's kept Seattle near the top of the league all these years . But they 're still the beta to Belichick 's alpha . There are certainly no guarantees in sports . It 's possible that Newton does n't rediscover his form the way Warner predicted . It 's possible the dropoff from the greatest quarterback of all time to a guy who signed for the league minimum will be instantly recognizable . But when it 's Belichick making the move , the natural instinct is to assume a home run vs. a whiff . What 's that quote from Star Wars ? `` There 's always a bigger fish . '' Happy as Seahawks fans have been with their front office , they know this to be true . Matt Calkins : mcalkins@seattletimes.com; on Twitter : @matt_calkins .

Those are significant jumps from Aug. 12 when Peoria , Tazewell and Woodford had positivity rates of 3.85 % , 3.6 % and 2.8 % , respectively . On Wednesday , two Illinois counties with positivity levels above 8 % were saddled with added restrictions in an effort to stem the spreading virus . Will and Kankakee Counties both lost indoor dining and faced other restrictions because of the rising number of cases . All across the Midwest , coronavirus infections are trending upward according to tracking by the Washington Post . Seven-day averages for new cases rose during the past week in the Dakotas , Illinois , Iowa , Kansas , Minnesota , Oklahoma and Wyoming , with the biggest jump in South Dakota and Wyoming , where average daily caseloads are up 58 percent and 50 percent , respectively . Wisconsin had a bit of good news , however , with case averages declining by about three percent over the past week . Researchers confirm that COVID-19 reinfections are possible Earlier this week , researchers in Hong Kong reported that a healthy 33-year old man had contracted COVID-19 a second time , about four and a half months after his first infection . The case is concerning because it suggests that immunity to the coronavirus may last only a few months in some people , according to the New York Times . Reinfection also has implications for vaccines being developed . A 15 minute , $ 5 coronavirus test will soon be available The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted Abbott Laboratories emergency-use authorization to market a $ 5 COVID-19 test which delivers results in 15 minutes , according to USA Today . The test is the size of a small greeting card and must be administered by a medical professional who takes a nasal swab . The antigen test is similar to a pregnancy test in that the card displays one line for a negative result and two for a positive . Abbot says it plans to ship millions of the tests in September , and up to 50 million by October , an effort that will significantly increase the nation 's supply of tests . Maine overnight camps may provide roadmap to preventing virus spread A federal study published Wednesday suggests techniques used by administrators of four camps in Maine , which prevented a COVID-19 outbreak among more than 1,000 campers and staff members , may provide a roadmap to helping contain the virus in other congregate settings . The four overnight camps in Maine conducted virus testing before and after campers arrived and made those who tested positive quarantine . Face masks and physical distancing were mandatory , cleaning and disinfection were extensive , campers and counselors stayed in the same groups while at the camp and activities were conducted outdoors as much as possible . According to the Washington Post , Jeffery Vergales , a pediatrician and senior author of the study , said that keeping staff and campers in separate bubbles the whole time was key . `` If we had a case , we would n't have to scramble to identify the contacts . We knew who they were , and we could very quickly quarantine those contacts , '' said Vergales . `` The fact that we had no known secondary spread is luck . The fact that we did n't have an exponential outbreak is planning . '' Fleeing a hurricane during a pandemic As if things were n't bad enough in Texas where 10,000 people have died from COVID-19 , the pandemic made it more difficult to evacuate and house people who fled hurricane Laura , which made landfall Thursday . According to the Austin American-Statesman , the number of people on evacuation buses was limited , and PPE was provided at emergency shelters . In some counties evacuees are staying in hotels instead of shelters . `` Obviously , this year it is different with the considerations for COVID-19 ; traditionally we have shelters set up in schools , that 's not going to be how we 're going to operate this year , '' said Austin 's Homeland Security and Emergency Management spokesman Bryce Bencivengo as evacuations were underway . Confusing testing recommendations clarified , sort of On Thursday , the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention attempted to clarify controversial testing guidelines published on Monday that people with no symptoms `` do not necessarily need a test , '' even if they are exposed to an infected person , according to USA Today . CDC Director Robert Redfield said in a statement that people who come in close contact with a confirmed or probable COVID-19 patient could be tested , even if they do n't have symptoms . But the statement falls short of previous CDC guidance which recommended that contacts of infected people be tested to stem asymptomatic transmission . `` Everyone who needs a COVID-19 test , can get a test . Everyone who wants a test does not necessarily need a test ; the key is to engage the needed public health community in the decision with the appropriate follow-up action , '' said Redfield .

New cases are still being added and health officials continue to advise caution , but the after-holiday spike appears to be over as both new daily cases and hospitalizations have started deflating . Looking at data from the state 's COVID-19 dashboard Indiana Health District 3 -- which covers LaGrange , Steuben Noble , DeKalb , Allen , Whitley , Adams , Wells , Huntington , Wabash and Miami counties -- went through a spike that may have started around mid-May but became more prominent around the holiday weekend . Multiple data sets including new cases , testing positivity , deaths and hospitalizations all reveal an increase in COVID-19 activity across that period , which has since fallen off . New daily cases for the region hit a low point around May 12 , when only 16 cases were reported for the entire 11-county region . The low point on the downslope of cases from April and May , during Indiana 's stay-at-home order when the virus first starting making inroads in communities . After May 12 , however , daily cases began increasing again , hitting an outlier all-time high on May 29 of 136 cases regionally . The day-to-day increase continued on a steady upward slope to high of 96 new cases in District 3 on June 10 . Since June 10 , however , daily cases have been dropping across the district , to 50 cases as of Saturday . While testing had also increased significantly , the surge in new testing was also accompanied by a rising positivity rate . According to the state 's data , the district 's positivity rate average bottomed out at about 4.6 % on May 15 , but after that point started rising on a steady upward slope , hitting a high of 13.7 % on June 6 . While statewide the positivity rate has generally decreased as testing increased -- testing was broadened out to asymptomatic people and then to anyone who wanted testing , which typically results in more well people getting tested and showing up negative -- the region showed increasing positivity for that four-week stretch . That means that , even as testing went up , the number of positive results increased at a larger rate , indicating that a local outbreak may have been at play . Deaths in the region held at zero per day from May 18-22 , before starting back up after that period , hitting a high of six deaths in the region on June 15 before slowing again since . Another key metric -- hospitalizations -- also showed that the area was going through a surge during the late-May to mid-June time period . District 3 had 199 patients in hospitals back on April 8 , a figure that was in a steady decline until about May 14 , when the region hit a hospital census low of just 72 patients . After May 14 , though , total hospitalization began to increase , slowly at first before rising to 128 on May 26 . After a small decline for about a week to 84 admitted as of June 1 , the region saw another period of increasing hospitalizations to 159 overall patients on June 16 . The regional hospital census has been in decline for the two weeks since , with the current number of people admitted sitting at 95 as of Sunday . District 3 's intensive care unit bed utilization also shrank during the time , with about 57 % available on May 11 , to just 18.2 % available on June 18 . Much of that decrease in capacity , however , appeared to be from non-COVID-19 sources , as the percentage of beds in use for COVID-19 patients went from just under 10 % to a high point of 19 % over the period . Ventilator capacity in the region has remained strong , with around 80 % or more ventilator availability on a daily basis in District 3 . Indiana as a whole has made much smoother improvement over time , with the state 's overall case rate , death rate and hospitalizations in steady decline with no noteworthy changes since . And while District 3 showed multiple signs of a localized surge in the past month , more recent data points suggest that the region is coming out of it and making improvements once again .", "seg_content_paragraph_starts": "0 30 63 120 150 204 251 273 294 339 390 422 460 484 522 545 577 605 637 680 705 738", "simhash": "ec1f2706d3382a11cea9f26b11f5d871", "spacy_content_loc": ["INDIANAPOLIS", "Indiana", "Indiana", "LaGrange", "DeKalb", "Huntington", "Wabash", "Miami", "Indiana", "Indiana"], "spacy_content_num": ["only 16", "first", "136", "96", "3", "50", "about 4.6 %", "13.7 %", "zero", "six", "3", "199", "just 72", "first", "128", "159", "95", "about 57 %", "just 18.2 %", "just under 10 %", "19 %", "around 80 %", "3"], "spacy_content_org": ["Indiana State Department of Health", "Allen , Whitley , Adams", "District 3"], "spacy_content_otr": [], "spacy_content_per": ["Steuben Noble", "Wells"], "spacy_content_tim": ["daily", "mid-May", "the holiday weekend", "daily", "May 12", "April", "May", "May 12", "daily", "May 29", "day", "June 10", "June 10", "daily", "Saturday", "May 15", "June 6", "four-week", "May 18-22", "June 15", "the late-May", "mid-June", "April 8", "about May 14", "May 14", "May 26", "about a week to 84", "June 1", "June 16", "the two weeks", "Sunday", "May 11", "June 18", "daily", "the past month"], "spacy_title_loc": ["Northeast Indiana"], "spacy_title_num": [], "spacy_title_org": [], "spacy_title_otr": [], "spacy_title_per": [], "spacy_title_tim": [], "text_category": {}, "title_c_count": 7, "tpc_m": {"t405": 0.2125362902879715, "t650": 0.10239322483539581}, "url": "https://www.kpcnews.com/covid-19/article_896892c4-7421-5af3-aa56-1a40a76526a3.html"}

The Texas Health and Human Services Commission on Monday extended the deadline for applying to July 31 . Families that were on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in March do n't need to apply for the program known as Pandemic-EBT , short for electronic benefits transfer . These benefits were automatically deposited on their Lone Star Card -- the debit-like card Texas uses to distribute SNAP aid -- in early June . Other families , including those that enrolled in SNAP after March , have through July 31 to submit applications for the food benefits program . Here 's what parents and guardians need to know when applying for the benefits . Who is eligible ? Schoolchildren up to 21 years old who received free or reduced-priced meals at school this school year are eligible for the program . Although families who receive SNAP automatically got benefits for children 5 to 18 years old , they also have through July 31 to apply for benefits if they have eligible children under 5 years old or between the ages of 19 and 21 . Infants and toddlers are not eligible for Pandemic-EBT . If Congress were to pass the HEROES Act -- another multitrillion-dollar coronavirus relief bill -- toddlers would be eligible for Pandemic-EBT , and benefits would extend through the summer , said Rachel Cooper , a senior policy analyst with Every Texan , a left-leaning think tank previously known as the Center for Public Policy Priorities . How much money will my family get ? The program will pay out a lump sum of $ 285 per eligible child , or about $ 5.70 to cover both breakfast and lunch for each canceled day of school . Guardians of two kids who missed out on school meals would receive $ 570 in benefits , guardians of three kids would get $ 855 , and so on . This is a one-time payment . Once approved , families will get one Texas Pandemic-EBT card in the mail preloaded with funds . The card works just like a debit card but can only be used for food . Pandemic-EBT follows the same rules as SNAP . Families ca n't use either benefit for hot and prepared food , like a hot sandwich meant to be eaten immediately , alcohol or tobacco products . Benefits can not be used at restaurants . How do I apply ? School districts should have sent out a link to the application in the first week of June . The application is straightforward . Parents and guardians will fill out details like the child 's name , address and school ID , Cooper said . When will I get my benefits ? Families should get their Pandemic-EBT cards in the mail within seven to 10 days of submitting their applications as long as the information provided on the online application matches the records submitted by the Texas Education Agency and Texas Department of Agriculture . If the information does n't match , officials will follow up with both departments , which may delay when a family gets its card , said Elliott Sprehe , a spokesperson for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission , the department that oversees Pandemic-EBT . The commission said it will process orders as they come in , once it has a list of the children who get free or reduced-price school meals . Does Pandemic-EBT affect my ability to get other benefits like unemployment or SNAP ? No . The school meal benefit will not affect eligibility for other benefits . How long do I have to spend the benefits ? Unused benefits expire after a year . Is my child still eligible if the school district has continued to provide meals ? Yes , Pandemic-EBT is an additional benefit , not a replacement for programs like grab-and-go school meals or summer meals . Do you have to be a citizen to get Pandemic-EBT ? No , any child is eligible for the program , regardless of their immigration status or that of their caregiver . While immigrant families may worry that applying for benefits will hurt their chances to become legal residents under the public charge rule -- which penalizes immigrants who 've used public benefits for a certain period of time -- Pandemic-EBT does not count toward that rule . Does my child qualify if they get free meals at their day care ? Maybe . If the child attends Head Start or a pre-K program that participates in the National School Lunch Program , they are eligible for the food benefits program . Are kids in charter and private schools eligible ? Yes , as long as the school provided meals through the National School Lunch Program and/or School Breakfast Programs .

Tony Ingle , who played and coached at Dalton State College ; Steve Prohm , Iowa State University 's head men 's basketball coach and a Northwest Whitfield High School alumnus ; and Sam Purcell , the associate head coach for the University of Louisville 's women 's basketball team and a Southeast Whitfield High School graduate , were among the speakers for the virtual clinic . `` It was really cool to see them and their connections with Dalton , '' Dyer said . `` What a great sports town that is . '' The work ethic he observed here helped launch his career in athletics , first as an athlete at Northwest Whitfield , then as a coach , and now as an administrator , he said . `` You learn more from what you observe than what you see , '' and the hard work he saw from his father and so many other inspired him . Much of his family still resides in the area , he added , noting Dalton is `` a blue-collar town . '' While `` playing deep in the state tournament and '' burying nine three-pointers in a game stand out as memories from his Bruins career , nothing can match meeting his wife , Candice , at Northwest Whitfield , Dyer said . `` She 's the rock behind all this . '' For Purcell , growing up in this region `` instilled a work ethic in me '' that 's earned him coaching positions across the country , including his current role at Louisville , which concluded its 2019-20 season at 28-4 before the rest of the campaign was canceled due to the pandemic , he said . `` I have a true love and appreciation for where I was raised . '' Purcell 's father worked in the carpet industry , and the family relocated to Whitfield County when Sam was in the third grade . He started his high school career at Northwest but transferred to Southeast , from which he graduated in 1998 , and it was during high school that he and Dyer became friends . `` I used to pick -LRB- Dyer -RRB- up for breakfast club workouts at 6:30 a.m. , and we lived in Varnell , so you can imagine how early we had to get up to drive all the way across the county to Southeast , '' he said with a chuckle . `` I loved the game of basketball . '' Purcell 's entree into basketball coaching came as a video coordinator at Auburn University , and the salary was so meager , he had to work two other jobs , but he was committed to a career in the game , he said . In his winding career , he 's gone to places `` no one else wanted to go , but I would n't have it any other way . '' `` Go to a place , and make it yours , '' he advised . `` Roll your sleeves up , and get to work , because that 's what Dalton people do . '' Growing up here , Purcell surrounded himself with positive people he could learn from , and he listened with `` open ears , '' he said . `` People here invested in me , and I 'm so thankful and grateful . '' Ingle likewise `` listened to and respected adults '' in this area , because he saw so many flourish after `` starting from nothing , '' he said . `` I always wanted my hometown to be proud of me , and Dalton is in my DNA . '' From his father , who worked in a cotton mill , Ingle learned `` how to work , '' and from his mother , he `` learned how to love , '' he said . His Dalton coaches `` taught me discipline , basketball , and how to stay on the right track . '' `` Dalton has been everything to me , -LRB- and -RRB- I 've been blessed , '' said Ingle , who guided the Dalton State men 's team to the NAIA national championship in 2015 , the same year he was NAIA 's coach of the year . `` That 's the truth .

Cantrell had already telegraphed that she would ask U.S. District Judge Lance Africk to halt plans for a new 89-bed jail building meant to house inmates with medical and mental health problems . But a court motion on Monday marked the lengthiest and most formal request yet from the city . Africk oversees the jail 's reform agreement with the federal government , known as a consent decree , and could accept or reject the city 's request . `` This administration is focused on making decisions that take into account all of the relevant factors when it comes to committing City resources , and doing what is right for all of our people , '' Cantrell said in a statement . `` We have to meet the many challenges being presented by the COVID-19 pandemic , as well as address our community 's call for reform . We believe this action meets both challenges . '' The Federal Emergency Management Administration would pay for at least $ 36 million of the cost of the new building planned for the vacant space between the main Orleans Justice Center and the jail 's kitchen on Perdido Street in Mid-City . However , the city says it could be on the hook for $ 15 million above that cost if the expansion plan goes forward . Speaking outside City Hall , city infrastructure chief Ramsey Green said the city believes the Temporary Detention Center , which is in the final weeks of a $ 6.3 million renovation , will be adequate to house inmates with mental health problems through at least 2022 . That renovation was meant to serve only as a stopgap until the permanent jail expansion , known as `` Phase III , '' is built . The city has n't made a final determination on whether it will move to retrofit the main jail as a permanent solution for housing inmates with mental and medical problems , Green said . Advocates have long proposed a rehab of the main lockup , pointing to the long-term decline in the jail inmate population . Last year the jail had an average daily population of 1,160 inmates , compared to 2,645 inmates in 2012 , and it 's population has dipped well below 1,000 people during the pandemic . However , Sheriff Marlin Gusman has dismissed the jail rehab plan as a fantasy . While the main jail building has space for 1,438 beds , he says he needs elbow room to separate inmates who ca n't be mixed , such as people from warring gangs or youths and adults . Africk has expressed serious doubts about the city 's move to call off the jail expansion , which he has long said is required to provide adequate care to dozens of inmates at the long-troubled jail . Africk did n't immediately rule on the city 's request for a quick hearing on its motion . In its filing on Monday , the city said while Africk has ordered the construction of the jail expansion , it 's no longer needed to provide adequate care . They point to the increasingly positive reviews of jail conditions from court-appointed monitors and one of their advisers . In an affidavit with the city 's filing , Ronald Shansky , a doctor who 's served as a court expert on correctional care for decades , said federal court monitors have n't opined that a lack of an infirmary is holding the jail back from reaching compliance with the consent decree . Shansky said adequate staffing and training were more important than facilities , and a `` secure and dedicated ward '' of a nearby hospital could substitute for a building on the jail campus itself . Gusman 's office did n't immediately respond to a request for comment . Gusman , who 's independently elected , oversees the jail with an administrator appointed by Africk , but the city is responsible under state law for providing its facilities . The sheriff last month contended in a court filing that it was time for the court to terminate the consent decree because he 's brought the lockup into compliance with the Constitution . In its filing on Monday , the city seemed to back that assertion . `` As the OPSO is at near full compliance with the rigorous Consent Decree without the Phase III facility , the City and OPSO are well poised to develop a new plan to continue providing constitutionally adequate services for those with serious mental illness in its custody in lieu of constructing the Phase III facility , '' the city said . Jail reform advocates do n't agree with the city about whether the jail 's done with its reform process . `` Serious deficiencies in the medical and mental health care provided in OJC continue to result in harm to the people imprisoned at the jail , '' said Emily Washington , an attorney at the MacArthur Justice Center in New Orleans who represents inmates under the consent decree agreement . `` A swift and effective means of providing constitutional care must be prioritized . Given this administration 's notable absence from the ongoing efforts to reform conditions at the facility , the City can not support its broad declarations of compliance . '' One group did hail Cantrell 's move to put the expansion plan on ice , however . `` The consideration of a new jail facility in our resource-strapped city should not have made it this far , but we 're encouraged that the city has finally acknowledged the disapproval and demands of our community , '' said Sade Dumas , executive director of the Orleans Parish Prison Reform Coalition .", "seg_content_paragraph_starts": "0 38 71 117 195 262 309 369 425 477 514 532 581 634 669 712 759 820 840 933 950", "simhash": "5cc0a3fac9322a3a6a9bdd1fd4046ecb", "spacy_content_loc": ["New Orleans", "U.S.", "Perdido Street", "Mid-City", "City Hall", "New Orleans"], "spacy_content_num": ["at least $ 36 million", "$ 15 million", "$ 6.3 million", "1,160", "2,645", "1,000", "1,438", "dozens", "one"], "spacy_content_org": ["The Federal Emergency Management Administration", "Orleans Justice Center", "the Temporary Detention Center", "Green", "Gusman", "OPSO", "OPSO", "OJC", "the MacArthur Justice Center"], "spacy_content_otr": ["Constitution"], "spacy_content_per": ["LaToya Cantrell", "Cantrell", "Lance Africk", "Africk", "Cantrell", "Ramsey Green", "Marlin Gusman", "Africk", "Africk", "Africk", "Ronald Shansky", "Shansky", "Gusman", "Africk", "Emily Washington"], "spacy_content_tim": ["Monday", "the final weeks", "at least 2022", "Last year", "2012", "Monday", "decades", "last month", "Monday"], "spacy_title_loc": ["New Orleans"], "spacy_title_num": [], "spacy_title_org": [], "spacy_title_otr": [], "spacy_title_per": [], "spacy_title_tim": [], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"PoliticsGovernment": 0.9245458841323853, "CrimePublicsafety": 1.0000098943710327}, "second_cat": {"PoliticsGovernment_Municipal": 0.9245458841323853, "CrimePublicsafety_Other": 1.0000098943710327}}, "title_c_count": 12, "tpc_m": {"t461": 0.1972191035747528, "t325": 0.14859800040721893}, "url": "https://www.nola.com/news/courts/article_edf57f5e-ba51-11ea-a865-37c98d8bc368.html"}

As usual , Brazos County Health Authority Dr. Seth Sullivan gave the most recent COVID-19 numbers to begin the conference . To date , there have been 1,943 positive cases , 821 recovered patients , 29 deaths and 19,651 total COVID-19 tests performed in the county . Currently there are 1,093 active cases and 34 hospitalizations . Below are the main takeaways from the conference . Increase in cases and deaths in the last week Sullivan said just in the past week , there have been four deaths and 683 reported positive cases . Of the additional cases , 36 percent were in the 18 to 24 age range . He also said local medical response systems are strained with the increase in cases . Sullivan also stressed that community spread is still a major problem , and said 72 percent of the reported cases since the last conference were the result of community spread . Hospitals are also at a 64 percent capacity average , and ICU beds are at 63 percent . When a person is tested for COVID-19 , they should receive a call with the results , Sullivan said . However , about 20 percent of those tested do not answer their calls . Sullivan said this may be due to the fact that the number may show up as an unknown number . Regardless , if no one answers , the BCHD leaves messages for every missed call . It is important to answer so health officials can determine if there is a chance of spread . `` We talked about this ` box-in ' process at previous press conferences , '' Sullivan said . `` It only works if we get this information and we can find your potential contacts . '' Isolation vs. quarantine There has been some confusion about the differences between self isolation and quarantine , according to Sullivan . He said isolation should be done if you have or think you may have contracted the virus . This means isolating yourself from the rest of the community . `` That isolation needs to be from the time -LSB- you -RSB- develop symptoms , for ten days , '' Sullivan said . `` For a full ten days after that time frame . '' Sullivan said the main difference is that one should quarantine for 14 days when you have been exposed to someone with the virus . Isolation is 10 days and for those with symptoms of the virus but are unsure as to whether they have been exposed or not . COVID-19 vs Influenza Sullivan said it is also important to note the major differences between the coronavirus and the seasonal flu , as the coronavirus has proven to be much more dangerous . Sullivan said the years with high numbers of flu cases do not compare to the number of COVID-19 cases he has seen since the outbreak . `` Lots of us have had flu before , or had our flu vaccinations , '' Sullivan said . `` Influenza does not have the ability to transmit through the population like COVID-19 has been able to do . We 're also realizing COVID-19 is more fatal than the flu . '' Local government Judge Steve Smith with the 361st District Court said there have been no in-person jury trials since early March . Working with Governor Abbotts ' operating plan , local courts have been performing meetings and hearings via Zoom . Smith said in-person meetings began taking place again on June 1 , accounting for health guidelines , such as social distancing and wearing a mask . Smith said opening courts to hearings will involve some changes . Face protection will be required and social distancing measures will also be taken . The presiding judge will also be wearing a face shield . This procedure is available to select counties , including Brazos County .", "seg_content_paragraph_starts": "0 22 88 97 196 284 320 323 370 405 454 457 513 565 567 632", "simhash": "e9352176aa34000f18b1d0bc75d5cc49", "spacy_content_loc": ["Brazos County", "BCHD", "Brazos County"], "spacy_content_num": ["1,943", "821", "29", "19,651", "1,093", "34", "four", "683", "36 percent", "72 percent", "64 percent", "63 percent", "about 20 percent"], "spacy_content_org": ["Brazos County Health Authority", "ICU", "District Court"], "spacy_content_otr": ["` For a full ten days after that time", "` Lots of us", "Influenza"], "spacy_content_per": ["Seth Sullivan", "Sullivan", "Sullivan", "Sullivan", "Sullivan", "Sullivan", "Sullivan", "Sullivan", "Sullivan", "Influenza Sullivan", "Sullivan", "Sullivan", "Steve Smith", "Abbotts", "Smith", "Smith"], "spacy_content_tim": ["June 29", "the last week", "the past week", "the 18 to 24", "ten days", "14 days", "10 days", "the years", "early March", "June 1"], "spacy_title_loc": ["Brazos County Health"], "spacy_title_num": [], "spacy_title_org": [], "spacy_title_otr": [], "spacy_title_per": [], "spacy_title_tim": ["June 29"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"PoliticsGovernment": 0.578343391418457}, "second_cat": {"PoliticsGovernment_Municipal": 0.578343391418457}}, "title_c_count": 12, "tpc_m": {"t106": 0.10910001397132874, "t388": 0.20072445273399353, "t421": 0.10829845070838928}, "url": "http://www.thebatt.com/news/takeaways-from-june-29-press-conference-with-the-brazos-county-health-district/article_5be6e07c-ba5f-11ea-bbb2-371e7fa16d38.html"}

The Class 1A and Class 2A teams already know who will be in their district and substate brackets . All of N'West Iowa 's Class 1A teams are in District 1 . That grouping is : Akron-Westfield , Gehlen Catholic -LRB- if the Jays return to play after being quarantined for a positive coronavirus test -RRB- , George-Little Rock , Hartley-Melvin-Sanborn , MMCRU , South O'Brien , Remsen St. Mary 's and Trinity Christian .

The Class 2A District 1 grouping is : Central Lyon , Okoboji , Sibley-Ocheyedan , Spirit Lake , West Lyon and Western Christian . West Lyon is unranked by the IHSBCA , but is ranked fourth by IA Baseball . The District 2 group is : Cherokee , Sheldon , Sioux Center , Sioux Central , Unity Christian and West Sioux . West Sioux is similar to West Lyon in that it is unranked by the IHSBCA but is ranked third by IA baseball . The IHSAA considers all postseason play in Class 3A and Class 4A to be substate play . The teams in Class 3A Substate 1 are Sioux City Heelan , Boyden-Hull/Rock Valley , Estherville Lincoln Central , LeMars , MOC-Floyd Valley , Sergeant Bluff-Luton , Spencer and Storm Lake .

The brackets in Class 1A and Class 2A will be finalized next week after the coaches ' seeding meetings . Seeding meetings for Class 3A and 4A will happen the week of July 6 . Individual attention In addition to the team rankings , the folks at IA Baseball also put together lists of the top players at each position going into the season in each class . The high opinion they have of the talent on the West Lyon team was obvious in those rankings . Wildcats ' senior Jalyn Gramstad was picked as the top second baseman in Class 2A . Sophomore first baseman Easton Fleshman is ranked second at his position . Senior Gavin Lorenzen is ranked fourth at catcher . Junior outfielder Jackson Kramer is ranked fifth . Senior pitcher Josh Van Beek is ranked 10th .

Scores of teams wo n't play a full 10-game season . Yet , there 's a silver lining . Many games that would not have been played have risen from the ashes of those that crashed and burned as coaches have scrambled to find replacements . Here are 10 outstanding games not on the original schedules , presented by COVID-19 . * Bainbridge at Valdosta -LRB- Sept. 18 -RRB- : Bainbridge won a state title in 2018 , Valdosta in 2016 . These two South Georgia teams have n't played each other since 2001 . In fact , Bainbridge has n't beaten Valdosta since 1993 , when Kirby Smart patrolled the Bearcats ' secondary . Bainbridge originally had two opponents from Florida and one from Alabama , and the Bearcats found coach Rush Propst and Valdosta willing to take them on as the Wildcats had lost a Florida opponent . Bainbridge , expected to be a top-10 team this year after dropping into Class 4A , also picked up interesting games with Mitchell County and Coffee . * Brookwood at Colquitt County -LRB- Sept. 11 -RRB- : Brookwood had planned to play South Carolina 's best team , Dutch Fork , and also lost a game with Alpharetta after Fulton County delayed its seasons . Colquitt County had home dates set with Cedar Grove , Westlake and Heritage of Conyers , whose counties delayed or canceled seasons . These two played in the 2017 semifinals -LRB- Colquitt County won -RRB- and in the 2010 final -LRB- Brookwood won -RRB- . * Carrollton at Collins Hill -LRB- Sept. 5 -RRB- : Carrollton was scheduled to play Cedartown as part of the Corky Kell Classic 's Rome doubleheader , but the Corky Kell pulled out of Rome , and Cedartown decided to delay its season a week . So Corky Kell organizers matched Carrollton with Collins Hill . AJC Super 11 linebacker Chaz Chambliss leads a Carrollton team with a half-dozen Division I recruits on defense . They 'll need them to stop quarterback Sam Horn and five-star receiver/defensive back Travis Hunter , who recently rejoined the team . * Dublin at Swainsboro -LRB- Oct. 2 -RRB- : This rivalry , played each season since 2008 , started in 1919 . Dublin won Class 2A last year but dropped to A-Public . Swainsboro believes it has its best team in 10 years , with Georgia Power 100 players and twins Fredrick and Cedric Seabrough . Swainsboro had a Savannah school on its non-region schedule , and Dublin was n't sure if Northeast in Macon was going to be ready , so they made a deal . * Greater Atlanta Christian at Denmark -LRB- Sept. 5 -RRB- : Like most smaller schools , GAC typically does n't court Class 7A opponents , but the Spartans lost scheduled games with two Tennessee teams and Salem of Rockdale County . Denmark was opening against Tucker in the Corky Kell until DeKalb County delayed . So that lured GAC into the Corky Kell . GAC , averaging 11.5 wins over the past eight seasons , wo n't be unarmed for the challenge . * Hapeville Charter at Milton -LRB- Sept. 25 -RRB- : Both were to play in the Freedom Bowl at Milton on Sept. 3-5 . That was canceled , and Milton also lost games with St. John 's of Washington , D.C. , and Life Christian of Virginia . These are Fulton County schools with recent state titles , Hapeville in 2017 in Class 2A and Milton in 2018 in 7A . * Lowndes at Archer -LRB- Sept. 4 -RRB- : Lowndes lost its Corky Kell game with Hoover when Georgia and Alabama had different ideas on starting . Lowndes ended up with Archer . That 's just as well . Lowndes , the 2019 runner-up , has garnered preseason Top 25 national rankings . Archer , which had been slated to play Dacula , has averaged 10 wins and won three region titles since 2013 . * Prince Avenue Christian at Holy Innocents ' -LRB- Sept. 25 -RRB- : Prince Avenue Christian was going to travel to Parish Episcopal of Dallas in October , and Holy Innocents ' was playing a Florida team in the canceled Freedom Bowl . Instead , these two Class A Private powers will meet for the first time at Riverwood , Holy Innocents ' home field . Holy Innocents ' had its best team in history last season , beating eventual champion Eagle 's Landing Christian in the regular season and reaching the semifinals . Prince Avenue Christian , a perennial contender , might have its best team yet , led by five-star quarterback Brock Vandagriff . * Rabun County at Jefferson -LRB- Sept. 18 -RRB- : Rabun County had scheduled four games with South Carolina teams . Jefferson had scheduled two . All were scratched . Rabun County and Jefferson have the most wins of any Northeast Georgia public schools over the past five seasons . Both have five-star junior recruits at quarterback -- Rabun County 's Gunner Stockton and Jefferson 's Malaki Starks . Jefferson , the bigger school , has won 17 straight in the series , last losing to Rabun County in 1955 . * Richmond Hill at Camden County -LRB- Sept. 4 -RRB- : For season openers , Richmond Hill was playing Jenkins of Savannah while Camden County was playing Columbia of DeKalb County . Savannah and DeKalb are in delay . So instead , fans will be treated to the unofficial Coastal Georgia championship to kick off the season . Richmond Academy broke through in 2019 , winning its first region title since 1996 , beating Valdosta in the playoffs and reaching the Class 6A semifinals . Waiting in Kingsland will be Camden 's best team in coach Bob Sphire 's four seasons . Other intriguing games not originally scheduled : Sandy Creek at Mary Persons , McEachern at Milton , Lee County at Tift County , Buford at North Cobb , Jones County at Grayson , Bainbridge at Coffee , Brookwood at Dacula , Marietta at Brookwood , Johns Creek at Milton , Hart County at Jefferson , Fellowship Christian at Trinity Christian , and Callaway at Thomas County Central .

the latest bettable numbers according to SportsBettingDime.com . With exactly two months remaining before the August 29 scheduled kick-off of the 2020-21 college football season , the odds-makers at SportsBettingDime.com , have set the over/under at 13.62 million fans attending FBS Division I games this season -- a 63 % decrease from the 36,831,692 fans that attended 888 regular season and bowl games last year . The odds-makers project the Pac-12 will have a 72 % attendance decline from 2019 , while SEC game attendance is projected to decline by 55 % . But , the odds-makers have set the over/under for the largest game attendance at 101,001 just in case things change between now and January . Over/Under Average Attendance 1 . Michigan : 38,850 -LRB- 35 % of 2019 avg -RRB- 2 . Penn State : 40,128 -LRB- 38 % of 2019 -RRB- 3 . Ohio State : 32,999 -LRB- 32 % of 2019 -RRB- 4 . Texas A&M : 44,700 -LRB- 44 % of 2019 -RRB- 5 .

That would obviously break the streak of crowds exceeding 100,000 , which dates all the way back to 1975 . It 's clear that a lot of things are changing in 2020 due to COVID-19 , and killing that streak would be a big one . What do you think it will look like and how would you bet it ? What does 38,000 people in The Big House look like ? If 38,850 was the number for the season opener , would you take the over or the under ? It 's an interesting topic because right now it 's hypothetical , but will likely become a reality in due time . We know the stadiums are n't going to be filled to capacity , but how extreme do the limitations need to be ? How hard will everyone try to make sure the games take place at all ? There are a ton of questions and not many answers at this time , which is why it 's fun to discuss .

An unincorporated Clark County town on the cusp of neighboring Arizona , and the Colorado River . A place about 7,000 call home , and where less than five residents tested positive for COVID-109 according to the Southern Nevada Health District . But Jackie Mazzeo , President of the Laughlin Chamber of Commerce , says that number may be higher , as locals have had difficulty accessing testing . `` They had to cross the bridge and go into Arizona if they would accept a Nevada resident , '' said Mazzeo . `` Otherwise , they would have to go all the way to Las Vegas . '' Laughlin is n't alone . During a Facebook Live event held by political action group Battle Born Progress , Mayor Daniel Corona of West Wendover says his town , located in the Northeastern part of the state , needs more access to testing too . `` Here in Elko County we have only tested one percent of our population , '' he said . '' If we are only testing one percent of our residents , how are we supposed to know the impact of this virus ? '' It 's a plea public health officials are responding to . Earlier this week , SNHD , in partnership with Clark County and the Laughlin Chamber organized a pop-up drive-thru test site in Laughlin , testing locals with or without COVID-19 symptoms . `` We have a very large retirement community here , '' said Mazzeo . `` So it was very important for us to get involved to make sure they are taken care of . '' The demand was there , says Clark County Commissioner Micheal Naft . Officials say the Laughlin site administered just under 900 nasal swab COVID-19 tests in two days . Clark County added there are more plans underway for additional remote testing sites in the next few weeks too . `` It 's an important step in expanding our testing throughout Clark County , '' said Naft . An important step , that Dr. Thomas Hunt , the Chair of Family Medicine at Roseman University , says is critical for rural communities . Dr. Hunt says there is generally less access to medical care in remote areas , they also tend to have higher populations of senior citizens vulnerable to the virus . `` One of the things we 've seen with the Coronavirus is that there 's a subset of people who get really sick who require ICU care and really high levels of care , '' said Dr. Hunt . `` Rural communities may provide some of this care , but it can very easily and quickly be overwhelmed . '' Diligent testing , he says , can prevent this from happening . Important , he says , because the virus , and its spread , will continue to impact all areas , no matter the size . `` The fact of the matter is this virus knows no boundaries , '' said Dr. Hunt . `` We 've seen it -- it 's a pandemic gone around the world .

The crowd of about 400 people entered into a standoff with Columbus police Thursday night , blocking the intersection of key streets in the Ohio capital for hours , the Columbus Dispatch reported . The demonstration began as a peaceful protest , but news outlets reported protesters began throwing objects like water bottles at officers , who responded by using tear gas on the crowd . A scuffle between a protester and an officer broke out around 9:45 p.m. , WCMH-TV reported . Videos obtained by The Associated Press show people smashing the building 's windows . One person briefly entered an office through a broken window but retreated before troopers within the building could catch him , said Ohio State Highway Patrol spokesman Lt. Craig Cvetan . Windows were boarded up early Friday and workers were placing plywood over undamaged windows out of precaution . ___ PHOENIX -- Hundreds rallied in downtown Phoenix to demonstrate against the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody in a protest that turned into a clash with police . Protesters who marched from Phoenix City Hall to the state Capitol on Thursday night into Friday morning carried signs reading , `` Silence is violence '' and `` Being black should not be a death sentence , '' The Arizona Republic reported . Around 11 p.m. , Phoenix police declared an unlawful assembly around the Capitol building . Protesters refused to leave the area , news outlets reported . The newspaper reported that rocks and water bottles were thrown at police . Video from local TV stations shows protesters hammering on the window of a police car , and the newspaper reported at least one police car window was broken . The Arizona Department of Public Safety and Phoenix police responded by firing pepper spray and rubber bullets at the crowd . ___ PETAL , Mississippi -- A Mississippi mayor who sparked outrage when he said he `` did n't see anything unreasonable '' about the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody is resisting calls to resign , including from his own town 's board of aldermen . `` Why in the world would anyone choose to become a police officer in our society today ? '' Petal Mayor Hal Marx tweeted Tuesday , the day four Minneapolis police officers were fired . The 46-year-old Floyd , a black man , was handcuffed and pleading for air as a white police officer kneeled on his neck Monday . In a follow-up tweet , the Republican directly referenced the Floyd case , saying he `` did n't see anything unreasonable '' : `` If you can say you ca n't breathe , you 're breathing . Most likely that man died of overdose or heart attack . Video does n't show his resistance that got him in that position . Police being crucified . '' ___ LOUISVILLE , Ky. -- Looking to defuse tensions in Louisville over the fatal shooting of a black woman by police who broke down her door , the victim 's mother on Friday called on protesters to continue demanding justice but to do it in `` the right way without hurting each other . '' Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear read the statement from Breonna Taylor 's mother hours after gunshots erupted , wounding at least seven people , during protests late Thursday outside City Hall . At least one person was in critical condition , Louisville Metro Police said early Friday . `` No officers discharged their service weapons , '' and all seven shot were civilians , police spokesman Sgt. Lamont Washington wrote in an email to The Associated Press . In her statement , Tamika Palmer said her daughter -- an emergency medical technician -- devoted her life to others , and the `` last thing she 'd want right now is any more violence . '' Thursday night 's demonstration came as protesters across the country , in cities including Los Angeles , Denver , New York and Memphis , turned out in alliance with demonstrators in Minneapolis , where George Floyd became the latest black man to die in police custody . ___ DENVER -- Protesters swarmed Denver on Thursday , blocking traffic and smashing vehicles while running from gunfire and police tear gas after a demonstration against the death of a black man in Minneapolis police custody turned violent . Hundreds of demonstrators stood in the downtown streets and chanted as darkness fell outside the Colorado State Capitol , where protesters spray-painted graffiti and broke car windows . In other areas of downtown Denver , police in riot gear fired gas canisters , used rubber bullets and walked in a phalanx through the streets to drive protesters away . The protest briefly spilled over onto Interstate 25 , blocking all lanes of traffic until police used tear gas to disperse the crowd . The protests continued into the night , despite Denver Mayor Michael Hancock pleading for calm . `` I certainly understand everyone 's frustration and sense of pain and disgust following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis , '' he said in a video posted on Twitter . `` But I want to plead to everyone . Let 's demonstrate , but let 's demonstrate peacefully . Leave the weapons home . '' ___ NEW YORK -- Protesters angry about the death of a black Minnesota man in police custody defied New York 's prohibition on public gatherings Thursday and staged a chaotic rally in Manhattan , where they faced off with officers enforcing social distancing rules . Scores of demonstrators , some wearing masks and some not , massed in Union Square and marched through the streets chanting `` I ca n't breathe '' and waving signs with slogans including `` Police brutality and murder must stop . '' Police officers , also wearing masks to protect against the virus , lined up opposite the demonstration . Video posted on social media showed occasional skirmishes as officers pushed the crowd back . The New York Police Department said more than 30 people had been taken into custody . Video showed at least one demonstrator being clubbed and others being wrestled to the ground as some protesters shoved officers and screamed insults . The police department said one officer was struck with a garbage can and another punched .", "seg_content_paragraph_starts": "0 18 62 96 145 190 208 209 239 282 308 208 372 419 479 208 546 600 647 677 714 208 762 800 883 899 208 957 1001 1043 1076", "simhash": "6721107b97d8882fa6370b46cd361e6c", "spacy_content_loc": ["the United States", "Minneapolis", "COLUMBUS", "Ohio", "Minneapolis", "Columbus", "Columbus", "Ohio", "Phoenix", "Minneapolis", "Phoenix City Hall", "Capitol", "Phoenix", "Capitol", "Phoenix", "Mississippi", "Mississippi", "Minneapolis", "Minneapolis", "Ky.", "Louisville", "Kentucky", "City Hall", "Los Angeles", "Denver", "New York", "Memphis", "Minneapolis", "Denver", "Minneapolis", "the Colorado State Capitol", "Denver", "Interstate 25"], "spacy_content_num": ["about 400", "One", "Hundreds", "at least one", "four", "at least seven", "At least one", "seven", "Hundreds"], "spacy_content_org": ["the Ohio Statehouse", "the Columbus Dispatch", "WCMH-TV", "The Associated Press", "Ohio State Highway Patrol", "The Arizona Department of Public Safety", "Republican", "Louisville Metro Police", "Sgt", "The Associated Press"], "spacy_content_otr": ["Silence"], "spacy_content_per": ["George Floyd", "George Floyd", "Craig Cvetan", "George Floyd", "George Floyd", "Hal Marx", "Floyd", "Floyd", "Andy Beshear", "Breonna Taylor 's", "Lamont Washington", "Tamika Palmer", "George Floyd"], "spacy_content_tim": ["Thursday", "night", "hours", "around 9:45 p.m.", "early Friday", "Thursday", "night", "Friday", "morning", "Around 11 p.m.", "today", "Tuesday", "the day", "Monday", "Friday", "late Thursday", "early Friday", "Thursday", "night", "Thursday"], "spacy_title_loc": ["Minneapolis", "US"], "spacy_title_num": [], "spacy_title_org": [], "spacy_title_otr": [], "spacy_title_per": [], "spacy_title_tim": [], "title_c_count": 9, "tpc_m": {"t980": 0.7346541881561279}, "url": "http://mountaineagle.com/stories/minneapolis-protests-spread-to-other-cities-across-the-us,25679"}	{"_id": "0PTOeBWI", "c_word": 974, "channels": ["Federal^^Police", "Military^^Officers", "Law^^Officers", "Law^^Enforcement^^Officers", "Military^^Police"], "countries": "us", "date": "2020-06-29 23:51:33", "domain": "sfgate.com", "epoch": {"$numberLong": "1593474693"}, "geotag": [{"name": "washington", "score": 0.8381110429763794, "coord": "38.907192,-77.036871", "pid": "washington,district_of_columbia", "type": "city"}], "highlightkeyword_list": [["Lafayette^^Square", 0.989235518464266], ["Donald^^Trump", 0.9265431495280954], ["White^^House", 0.009107655686883282], ["Gregory^^Monahan", 0.007361654851757509], ["Kishon^^McDonald", 0.006120912397506516], ["Albert^^Pike", 0.003037034344683303], ["Jonathan^^Turley", 0.0019868605322276036], ["Amelia^^Brace", 0.0015503600071565193], ["WASHINGTON", 6.3946938327807505E-6], ["Navy", 8.317262488639566E-7], ["Republican", 7.23771075703425E-7]], "kw_title": ["federal^^police^^officers", "protesters", "law^^enforcement^^officers", "Congress", "federal^^law^^enforcement", "excessive^^force", "White^^House"], "kws": ["federal^^police^^officers", "protesters", "law^^enforcement^^officers", "Military^^Police", "Congress", "police", "demonstrators", "federal^^law^^enforcement", "lawmakers", "Democratic^^lawmakers", "Republican^^lawmakers", "Park^^Police^^officials", "protests", "police^^batons", "excessive^^force", "Judiciary^^Square", "White^^House", "soldiers", "Republicans", "barricades"], "ne_content_location": {"District of Columbia": 1, "Lafayette Square": 2, "Judiciary Square": 1, "WASHINGTON": 1}, "ne_content_organization": {"Congress": 1, "George Washington University": 1, "U.S. Secret Service": 1, "Washington Post": 1, "Navy": 1, "National Guard": 1, "St. John 's Episcopal Church": 2, "Park Police": 3, "Republican": 1, "House Natural Resources Committee": 1}, "ne_content_person": {"McDonald": 1, "Turley": 1, "Kishon McDonald": 1, "Amelia Brace": 1, "Gregory Monahan": 1, "Donald Trump": 1, "Albert Pike": 1, "Monahan": 2, "Jonathan Turley": 1, "William Barr": 1, "Trump": 2}, "ne_title_location": {"White House": 1}, "ne_title_organization": {"Congress": 1}, "ne_title_person": {}, "paragraph_count": 21.0, "predicate_content": ["began", "described", "were", "testified", "said", "emit", "called", "declined", "played", "said", "said", "gathered", "wandered", "chanted", "music", "brought", "began", "broke", "fired", "fled", "wretched", "pulled", "played", "testified", "recalled", "said", "were", "used", "'re", "testified", "told", "pointed"], "predicate_title": ["begins"], "seg_content": "WASHINGTON - Congress on Monday began to investigate tactics used by federal law enforcement officers to clear protesters near Lafayette Square ahead of President Donald Trump 's photo op in front of the pale yellow facade of St. John 's Episcopal Church . Protesters , journalists and witnesses who were caught in clouds of chemical irritants , hit with police batons , pelted by projectiles and shoved with riot shields described their experiences and injuries to lawmakers , whose confidence in police officers ' tactics seemed to splinter along party lines . The hearings before the House Natural Resources Committee were the first of several , with lawmakers signaling they have more questions about the types of weapons used and whether federal police officers issued verbal warnings before launching stun grenades and chemical irritants into the crowd . None of the witnesses heard verbal warnings issued , they testified . But in a letter to lawmakers , Park Police said three warnings were given - using a crowd control device known as LRAD , a Long Range Acoustic Device , for conveying information across large distances . The device , often used to order evacuations during natural disasters , also can emit sounds at a decibel and frequency so unpleasant that it can disperse crowds . No members of the Trump administration were called to testify . Park Police officials , who led the charge against protesters on June 1 , declined to attend , lawmakers said , because one protester who was called to speak is part of a federal lawsuit alleging that the administration authorized an `` unprovoked and frankly criminal attack '' on demonstrators engaging in their First Amendment right to protest . Republican lawmakers played several videos featuring property destruction - including protesters toppling the statue of Albert Pike , a Confederate officer , from its pedestal near Judiciary Square , on June 19 . They said such incidents were evidence that the demonstrations were not `` peaceful '' in nature - though many happened long after June 1 . George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley , who was called to testify as a legal expert , said that although federal law enforcement officers probably had the right to clear the park , it is less clear whether the manner they chose was lawful . Less than an hour before the District of Columbia 's 7 p.m. curfew - instituted as a response to looting and fire-setting around the city amid demonstrations on previous nights - hundreds of protesters were gathered . Journalists , clergy and humanitarian volunteers passing out water and masks to protect against the still-raging coronavirus wandered through the crowd as Park Police and National Guard members , wielding shields that said `` Military Police , '' lined up behind barricades . Protesters chanted in unison and held signs . Some played music while other danced and bopped in place . At least one person brought an easel to paint the scene . At about 6:30 p.m. , after Attorney General William Barr was seen walking through the park , officers began to move closer . Chaos broke out as federal officers charged down the street , pushing demonstrators eastward with shields and batons . Law enforcement fired rubber bullets at fleeing demonstrators , released caustic gas and threw exploding stun grenades into the crowd . Protesters fled from officers on foot and horseback - many still holding their hands up , shouting , `` Do n't shoot ! '' Others wretched , choking on clouds of chemicals in the air . Many pulled off masks as they coughed and wiped away tears . For some , the chaos played out on split-screen television broadcasts as the president strode to the front of St. John 's Episcopal Church and delivered remarks for a gaggle of cameras . Kishon McDonald , a Navy veteran who joined the June 1 protest after taking his daily run , testified that the protest was peaceful and calm when officers began to advance and fire into the crowd . He recalled feeling something explode near his ankle as he and others retreated from the line of police . `` It was excessive force , '' said McDonald , who compared his experience at the protest to being subjected to tear gas during military training exercises . `` We were n't prepared for that . They should n't have used -LSB- tear gas -RSB- on protesters - they 're not soldiers . '' Australian journalist Amelia Brace testified that she and a colleague cried `` media '' as officers punched their camera and shot at them with rubber bullets . Turley told lawmakers that the incident , which was caught on video , appeared `` entirely unjustified and unlawful . '' Democratic lawmakers pointed to Trump 's remarks as the reason law enforcement officers had deployed such aggressive tactics , but Republicans said that the timing was a coincidence - the U.S. Secret Service had for days been planning to install a large fence along the street that wrapped around Lafayette Square - and that officials needed to clear the area . Park Police Acting Chief Gregory Monahan issued a statement this month that detailed incidents in which he said more than 50 officers were hurt during protests , which began May 29 . Monahan said protesters had thrown `` projectiles , including bricks , frozen water bottles and caustic liquids '' at officers . At Monday 's hearing , Republican lawmakers said some protesters had thrown bottles of urine at police and shot off fireworks during demonstrations .

The Cardinals got stuck in Milwaukee for the same reason . And yet the Mets were allowed to fly home Thursday night as long as the two infected members of their traveling party -- an unidentified player and coach -- stayed behind in Miami -LRB- those linked to the pair by contact tracing also remained -RRB- . So why the variation ? Apparently , after the Mets and MLB consulted with health officials , it was determined that the safest course of action -- for the presumably healthy members of the team -- would be to get the heck out of Miami , the nation 's petri dish for COVID-19 . Sounds logical -- but risky nonetheless . There also was the possibility of transporting the virus back to New York through asymptomatic carriers , which could potentially infect anyone outside the team , such as family or friends . As a result , the Mets took extraordinary measures for the flight back , as one member of the traveling party described the trip . Some were given point-of-contact rapid tests as they boarded the plane , which was a significantly larger chartered aircraft to allow for more social distancing . Everyone wore KN95 respirators that had to be kept on throughout . No eating or drinking . More tests were administered upon arrival Thursday night , as well as Friday morning at Citi Field . Problem is , it will take at least another 48 to 72 hours to get a manageable grip on the situation , and the fear of a spread is likely to stretch beyond that , based on what we 've learned from the other outbreaks . That 's why scrapping this weekend 's Citi Field portion of the Subway Series was hardly a surprise . We 've come to expect such things by now . And from MLB 's perspective , postponing games between two teams in the same city , separated by 10 miles , is no doubt the easiest rescheduling they 'll have to do this season . That 's not the issue , whether it 's sacrificing Monday 's mutual off day or stacking up a couple of seven-inning doubleheaders at Yankee Stadium . The greater concern looking ahead is the accumulating fallout from these postponements , and the worry over a second surge at various league outposts . The top priority , of course is everyone 's health . Beyond that , the COVID-19 interference has turned this season into a war of attrition by ratcheting up the physical stress over an ever-shrinking window for baseball . The Mets had been considered a relatively safe environment , but the virus still crept in , and team officials could n't be sure when it did . Given that the coronavirus has an incubation period between two days and two weeks , it 's possible that the player and coach could have been infected in Philadelphia -- the stop before Miami -- or even in New York before the trip began . That 's where contact tracing comes in . But were the Mets ' safeguards effective along the way ? It 's going to take these next few days to find out . With the Marlins and Cardinals , the cases multiplied into the teens before being contained . The Reds were able to halt the spread at one player , so there is evidence the protocols can be effective . Considering that MLB was unable to employ a bubble concept for the regular season -- it 's being discussed for the playoffs -- this regional-travel concept is the best they could do . Relatively speaking , it has performed better than anyone could have anticipated despite the fact that nearly a month into the season , there has not been a single day that featured all 30 teams in action . Based on that stat alone , the coronavirus still is undefeated . It 's been a relentless foe from Opening Day -- when the Nationals ' Juan Soto tested positive hours before first pitch -- and certainly won the weekend in New York . We expect these disruptions to continue , too , and MLB to plow stubbornly ahead . The Mets had won three straight in Miami , their bats finally coming to life , before getting shut down . They 've also had two high-profile players opt out in Yoenis Cespedes and Marcus Stroman , so another shocking twist of adversity is nothing new . `` We talked about the challenges that we knew were coming , '' general manager Brodie Van Wagenen said after Stroman walked on Aug. 10 . `` As a team , we talked about health , talent and motivation . Those are the three things that were important to us when we started this season and those are the three things that we 're going to try to keep our focus on going forward . '' Right now , the coronavirus has derailed the Mets ' season for an indefinite period of time . And it 's the uncertainty surrounding the health of teammates , as well as a return date , that can be the hardest part .", "seg_content_paragraph_starts": "0 28 74 128 167 235 253 299 363 415 454 482 546 597 668 728 775 851", "simhash": "2fa4e682c0b8ab59ffc4ce9de957b02b", "spacy_content_loc": ["Philadelphia", "Milwaukee", "Miami", "Miami", "New York", "Citi Field", "Citi Field", "the Subway Series", "Yankee Stadium", "Philadelphia", "Miami", "New York", "New York", "Miami"], "spacy_content_num": ["two", "one", "between two", "10 miles", "a couple of", "seven", "second", "one", "30", "first", "three", "two", "three", "three"], "spacy_content_org": ["Marlins", "Cardinals", "Mets", "MLB", "Mets", "the traveling party", "MLB", "Mets", "Mets", "Marlins", "Cardinals", "Reds", "MLB", "MLB", "Mets", "Stroman", "Mets"], "spacy_content_otr": ["Opening Day"], "spacy_content_per": ["Mets", "KN95", "Juan Soto", "Yoenis Cespedes", "Marcus Stroman", "Brodie Van Wagenen"], "spacy_content_tim": ["a week", "Thursday", "night", "Thursday", "night", "Friday", "morning", "at least another 48 to 72 hours", "weekend", "Monday", "day", "this season", "between two days", "two weeks", "these next few days", "nearly a month", "a single day", "hours", "the weekend", "Aug. 10", "this season"], "spacy_title_loc": [], "spacy_title_num": [], "spacy_title_org": ["Mets", "MLB"], "spacy_title_otr": [], "spacy_title_per": [], "spacy_title_tim": [], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"Sports": 1.0}, "second_cat": {"Sports_Baseball": 1.0}, "third_cat": {"Sports_Baseball_MLB": 1.0}}, "title_c_count": 11, "tpc_m": {"t119": 0.1694970279932022, "t395": 0.27344873547554016}, "url": "https://www.newsday.com/sports/columnists/david-lennon/mets-yankees-coronavirus-quarantine-1.48388275"}	{"_id": "0PTOgEEt", "c_word": 1423, "channels": ["Mariners", "Rangers", "Multiple^^Players", "Baseball^^Players", "Younger^^Players"], "countries": "us", "date": "2020-06-29 22:55:00", "domain": "lookoutlanding.com", "epoch": {"$numberLong": "1593471300"}, "geotag": [{"name": "seattle", "score": 0.9702113270759583, "coord": "47.606209,-122.332071", "pid": "seattle,washington", "type": "city"}], "highlightkeyword_list": [["Perry^^Hill", 0.1025776609234857], ["Jarret^^DeHart", 0.02189417786780181], ["J.P.^^Crawford", 0.01085191877014374], ["Tim^^Laker", 0.0045291597168559015], ["Carson^^Vitale", 0.0021280089375969222], ["Dee^^Gordon", 0.0012710485218230816], ["Peoria^^Javelinas", 0.001095190016262901], ["Scott^^Servais", 9.146435105418554E-4], ["Pete^^Woodworth", 8.101559059771227E-4], ["Sam^^Delaplane", 7.471369035803201E-4], ["Jake^^Diekman", 6.930392150398747E-4], ["AZL^^Mariners", 6.211644747065052E-4], ["Trent^^Blank", 5.548645069745247E-4], ["Art^^Warren", 5.546238314949178E-4], ["Braves", 9.250897135231994E-7], ["AFL", 9.250897135231994E-7], ["Rangers", 9.196709989755516E-7], ["Seattle", 8.312304270987734E-7]], "kw_title": ["Mariners", "AZL^^Mariners"], "kws": ["Mariners", "Rangers", "AZL^^Mariners", "coaching^^players", "younger^^players", "Braves", "pre-existing^^health^^conditions", "multiple^^MLB^^Draft", "populations", "Twins", "average^^age", "early^^days", "fall", "Jake^^Diekman", "coaching^^staff", "complications", "circumstances", "age^^group", "Mitch^^Haniger", "Seattle"], "ne_content_location": {"Seattle": 3, "Cheney Stadium": 1, "Peoria Javelinas": 1}, "ne_content_organization": {"Dallas Baptist": 1, "Braves": 1, "AZL Mariners": 1, "AFL": 1, "Mariners ' Black Voices in Baseball": 1, "Mariners": 2, "Twins": 1, "Major League Field Coordinator": 1, "Rangers": 1, "Texas League": 1}, "ne_content_person": {"Pete Woodworth": 1, "Hill": 9, "Sam Delaplane": 1, "DeHart": 1, "Vitale": 2, "Dee Gordon": 1, "Delaplane": 1, "Jarret DeHart": 1, "Warren": 3, "Dave Sims": 1, "Carson Vitale": 1, "Art Warren": 1, "Gordon": 2, "Blank": 1, "Perry Hill": 6, "Trent Blank": 1, "Brian DeLunas": 2, "J.P.

As baseball looks to tentatively re-open , one panacea that has been freely passed around is the notion that most players , the majority of whom are in their twenties or early thirties and in prime physical condition , are generally about as low-risk as populations come , with a few exceptions , such as the Rangers ' Jake Diekman , who has ulcerative colitis , a chronic disease that can flare up painfully with no warning . However , even skimming over the entirely false assumption that those in this age group are somehow immune from the deadly effects of the virus , there remains the issue of coaches and managers . For context , the average age of a manager lands somewhere in the early 50s ; Joe Maddon will celebrate his 66th birthday this September , while Dusty Baker just turned 71 . 68-year-old Ron Washington has said he will wear a mask at all times while coaching third base for the Braves this season . To attempt to protect these populations who are more vulnerable to the deadly outcomes of the virus , some clubs , like the Twins , are sidelining personnel who fall into the high-risk category . Although the Mariners generally skew younger as a coaching staff -- even as Scott Servais falls right in that median for manager age at 53 -- there are still some coaches who fall into the high-risk demographic . Legendary infield coach Perry Hill is the very picture of spry , but celebrated his 68th birthday this past month . Like Diekman , hitting coach Tim Laker also has colitis , a disease he was first diagnosed with back in 1992 . And pitching coordinator Brian DeLunas has been on the transplant list awaiting a new kidney for over a year -LRB- for information on how you can help , click here -RRB- . In order to protect the health and safety of these members of the organization , the Mariners front office came to the difficult decision that the three high-risk coaches would work remotely for the 2020 season ; no in-person coaching sessions will be allowed . Hill , Laker , and DeLunas will not be permitted at the stadium this season , nor will they be allowed at the alternate training site Cheney Stadium . They are still employed by the team , and will be coaching players over the phone and via video conference . But in terms of hands-on tutoring , that 'll have to wait until 2021 , or at least until circumstances surrounding the virus allow a safer approach to teaching . Beyond the frustration this must present to each of the coaches impacted , it 's also a significant loss for the organization , as each has contributed to the team , specifically to younger players , in significant ways . Tim Laker worked extensively with Mitch Haniger before he came to Seattle , helping him re-tool his swing into one that would lead him to an All-Star season . Brian DeLunas has impacted pitching prospects and helped them develop their stuff in ways they did n't necessarily know how to on their own . `` He 's had a lot to do with my pitch strategy and pitch design , '' Sam Delaplane said . `` The guy just knows a ton . '' Fellow reliever Art Warren agrees with Delaplane 's assessment , noting that DeLunas is the go-to guy in the organization to pick his brain about pitching ops , and that even in the short time they have spent together in Seattle , DeLunas has offered him `` thoughtful and useful information on spin axis for particular pitches . '' But even beyond the technical information , Warren tells a story of DeLunas , on a trip to the Texas League last season , taking time out of his trip to talk with the young reliever , anxious about the possibility of a big-league callup . DeLunas encouraged Warren to remain faithful and wait for his moment -- something Warren reflected on fondly when his moment did come later that season . The loss of the presence of Perry Hill has negative ramifications both on and off the diamond . During the Mariners ' Black Voices in Baseball panel that streamed a couple weeks ago , Dave Sims prompted the group to talk about `` some good things that have happened to you guys as a professional baseball player . '' `` Perry Hill , '' responded Dee Gordon promptly . He paused , then repeated it . `` Perry Hill , Perry Hill , Perry Hill . Per.ry . Hill . '' His co-panelists and fellow infielders J.P. Crawford and Shed Long were on mute but put up `` plus one '' fingers to symbolize agreement with what Gordon was saying . Dee , who gave Hill a copy of his Gold Glove award in recognition for the role he played in gaining Gordon that accolade , praised Hill for `` not seeing color '' but holding every player accountable to the same high standards . Shed Long enthusiastically agreed , saying Hill `` cares about you for the person that you are . '' J.P. Crawford , another player whose defense has improved markedly under Hill 's tutelage , had maybe the warmest words to say about the man they call `` Bone . '' `` He definitely saved my career , man , '' said J.P. Crawford . `` He always holds you accountable . You could call him at 2 AM , 3 AM , you know he 's going to answer . He 's one of those coaches you know you could go to for anything and you know he 's got your back , he 's got you in anything . And you do n't get a lot of those at all . '' Hill 's impact on the diamond is without question ; it shines through in the improved defense of the players he coaches . However , to have a coach whom all players feel treats them fairly and equitably absent from the team at this particular time in history is a negative effect that stretches beyond the lines of the baseball field . In terms of what 's next for the team , the front office has a short-term contingency plan , though the final details are still being ironed out . Jarret DeHart will take over most of the in-game hitting strategy and coaching in lieu of Laker . DeHart has been with Seattle since 2018 when he originally served as a coach for the AZL Mariners . Last season he served as a minor league hitting strategist for the organization . In November , he was named an assistant hitting coach for the big league club . Pitching Strategist Coordinator Trent Blank will take over for DeLunas as the Bullpen Coach in 2020 . Blank also joined the organization following the 2018 season . He was previously the Director of Player Development at Dallas Baptist , a school known for its strong pitching development that features multiple MLB Draft picks in any given year . Pitching Coach Pete Woodworth will also assist in some bullpen coaching responsibilities pre - and post-game . Carson Vitale will likely take over for Hill at first base in 2020 . Vitale has been a quick mover in the organization since being hired in 2017 . He served as a minor league field coordinator during his first two seasons with the team , but was promoted to Major League Field Coordinator for the 2020 campaign after managing the Peoria Javelinas in the AFL this past season . Vitale is a favorite among players and team personnel for his work ethic and enthusiasm , as well as his luxurious , Karen-infuriating beard . Both Laker and Hill have one year left on their contracts following the 2020 season ; DeLunas 's contract is up in October .", "seg_content_paragraph_starts": "0 280 393 518 612 642 773 832 894 957 988 1071 1133 1229 1304 1399", "simhash": "b43528756651aa8a6845967cedbf316f", "spacy_content_loc": ["Cheney Stadium", "Seattle", "Seattle"], "spacy_content_num": ["one", "those over 65", "one", "66th", "third", "68th", "first", "three"], "spacy_content_org": ["Rangers", "Braves", "Twins", "Mariners", "Mariners", "Hill", "Laker", "the Texas League", "Shed Long", "Gold Glove"], "spacy_content_otr": ["All-Star", "` He 's", "` not seei"], "spacy_content_per": ["Jake Diekman", "Joe Maddon", "Dusty Baker", "Ron Washington", "Scott Servais", "Perry Hill", "Diekman", "Tim Laker", "Brian DeLunas", "DeLunas", "Tim Laker", "Mitch Haniger", "Brian DeLunas", "Sam Delaplane", "Art Warren", "Delaplane", "DeLunas", "DeLunas", "Warren", "DeLunas", "DeLunas", "Warren", "Warren", "Perry Hill", "Dave Sims", "Perry Hill", "Dee Gordon", "Perry Hill", "Perry Hill", "Perry Hill", "Per.ry", "Hill", "J.P.

I switched the basil to italian seasoning and doubled it . This turned out amazing ! Wish I had some crusty italian bread to soak up to sauce because it did get a little watery from the zucchini . Will be making this again and again ! Thank you for a great recipe ! mntngirljane Aug 19 , 2013 My mother-in-law introduced this meal to us and we loved it ! To make it a bit more filling we added rotini noodles into the dish . We also use yellow squash with the zucchini because they work so together -LRB- and our garden runneth over ! -RRB- In the end , we always have enough to make a 9x13 dish instead .

This past spring we saw a `` Full Worm Moon '' in March followed by a pink supermoon in April . In July , we were treated to an array of astronomical wonders including double meteor showers and a lunar eclipse . As we settle into August , we can expect a Perseid meteor shower as well as spot Venus in conjunction with the crescent moon . But as you may recall from this 2020 full moon list , a blue moon is also on the menu for this year 's skies . This rare phenomenon will occur on October , 31st 2020 . That 's right , a blue moon on Halloween night -- talk about epic ! What is a blue moon ? Now , in a perfect world , a blue moon would most likely mean that the moon appears blue during the night . That 's usually not the case , unfortunately . A moon is n't considered a `` blue moon '' because of its color , but rather when it occurs . As you may already know , full moons typically occur once a month . When 13 fulls moons occur in one year instead of 12 , that means you 've got a blue moon -LRB- and its uncommon nature is the basis for the phrase `` once in a blue moon . -RRB- . There are two types of blue moons : A full moon can be considered blue when it 's the second of two full moons in a calendar month -LRB- aka a monthly blue moon -RRB- , or when it 's the third of four full moons in a single season -LRB- aka a seasonal blue moon -RRB- , according to Earth Sky . While there 's a good chance October 's blue moon wo n't actually appear blue for us Earth dwellers down below , it does n't mean it 's completely impossible . According to timeanddate , a moon can appear blue if the atmosphere is filled with dust or smoke particles of a certain size . Therefore , if a massive volcanic eruption occurred , that could give the moon a blueish tone . The 1980 eruption of Mt. St. Helens in the US , the 1983 eruption of Mt. Krakatoa in Indonesia , and the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines have all made the moon look blue . What type of blue moon will we see in 2020 ? This year 's blue moon will be a monthly blue moon . There will be a full moon on October 1st and October 31 , 2020 . Because October has two full moons scheduled , the latter full moon is dubbed as the blue moon . According to AccuWeather meteorologist Brian Lada , we wo n't be able to catch another blue moon on Halloween night until 2039 . With that in mind , best to mark your calendars now !

The eclipse will be brought on by what 's commonly known as the `` Full Buck Moon , '' and will be visible from most of North America , except the northernmost regions of Canada and Alaska . While the celestial showcase is certainly something to look forward to , experts say this specific type of eclipse is bit harder to notice . According to Earthsky.org , there are three kinds of lunar eclipses : a total eclipse , a partial eclipse and a penumbral eclipse . `` This third kind of lunar eclipse -LSB- penumbral -RSB- is much more subtle , and much more difficult to observe , than either a total or partial eclipse of the moon , '' the website explained . `` Then again ... very observant people will notice something strange happening on the moon , even while not knowing an eclipse is taking place . '' The website writes that in a penumbral lunar eclipse , the Moon does n't go into the Earth 's main darker umbra shadow , making this eclipse in particular , harder to observe . The Old Farmer 's Almanac says that July 's full moon is called the `` Buck Moon , '' marking the time of year that wild bucks ' antlers are fully grown , according to Native American folklore .

The blowback was immediate for his unforgivable crime of shaking the drink instead of stirring it . Bartenders and cocktail wonks immediately took to Twitter to condemn this serious mixology faux pas , even while many more found his drink-mixing demeanor more than a little bit charming . For the record , yes , technically this cocktail should not be shaken , but the reaction was a little ridiculous . While this might have been the first time some people had even heard of the Negroni , the drink has been popular for many years . Cocktail historian and writer David Wondrich believes it 's particularly popular today because it `` pushes a lot of modern buttons . '' First of all , it 's a bitter drink that uses assertively flavored ingredients -LRB- Campari , sweet vermouth , and gin -RRB- , which he says are in vogue . `` It 's not particularly high ABV , which makes it accessible , although it 's got plenty of flavor and does n't taste weak , '' he said . `` You can make it up -LRB- popular with some -RRB- , or on the rocks , or rock -- trendy ... And , of course , it 's easy to make . '' According to Daniel Warrilow , Italian portfolio ambassador for Campari America , the Negroni 's origins date back to 1919 when Count Camillo Negroni dropped by the Caffè Casoni in Via de ' Tornabuoni in Florence for a cool drink . `` Inspired by a recent trip to London where he became exposed to its prevailing gin scene , the Count requested his Americano cocktail -LRB- Campari , sweet vermouth , soda water -RRB- with gin rather than the usual soda water , '' he said . `` The bartender , Fosco Scarselli , added a twist of orange rather than the Americano 's typical lemon peel . '' After that , people began to belly up to the bar and ask for an Americano ` The Negroni ' way , cementing its status as an iconic cocktail . Wondrich has written extensively about the origins of the drink , and provides the caveat that while this is the accepted story behind the drink , factual documentation is lacking . According to Wondrich , it 's not until 1947 that the Negroni recipe actually turns up in a cocktail book , and from there the rest is tipsy history . The bitter element of a Negroni can be a challenge for some drinkers , but Warrilow says that practice makes perfect . `` Some say you need to try Campari three times before you acquire a taste for it , '' he said . `` If a sweeter taste profile is desired , there are many ways to cut through the bitterness with supplemental ingredients . '' One way to do this is by adding citrus to the drink , which he says will complement the trademark sweetness and floral notes , while masking some of the bitter flavors . Linden Pride , co-owner of New York City 's Dante , knows a thing or two about the Negroni . The bar , voted World 's Best Bar in 2019 , features at least nine variations of the drink on its extensive and eclectic menu . For Pride , the drink 's inherent simplicity makes it nearly impossible to screw up . `` The bitter component of the cocktail is usually what pulls you in -- especially as this is a taste profile that is generally learnt , over time , as our pallet matures , '' he said . `` I 've always felt that the true wonder of the Negroni is that sense of discovery you embark upon once you start to un-peel the layers . '' He says that swapping out the gin for mezcal , bourbon , or other styles of gin , using dry vermouth instead of sweet , or even using other types of Italian bitters are ways of building upon the classic recipe . `` The complexity and variations on the drink are seemingly endless . '' Now that you know the ingredients and flavor profile , and understand a little bit about the history of the drink , why not try making one for yourself at home ? Also , consider making a batch of Negronis which you can keep in the freezer like Warrilow does for quick and easy access . `` That way it 's always cold and all I have to do is pour it into a glass with ice and add an orange twist , '' he said . Here are two foolproof recipes to channel your inner Tucci from Linden and Warrilow . Negroni ` On Tap ' -LRB- Created by Dante , NYC -RRB- 1 oz Bombay Sapphire 3/4 oz Campari 3/4 oz Martini & Rossi sweet vermouth Stir and strain ingredients on one large ice cube in rocks glass .

He had been trying to get some final normalcy into his life , attending a weekend of softball games with his family , cut off from the world of social media and the movement among college football players , including his own at WVU , toward actively pushing to have their game played in the fall . `` I did n't encourage them to get into it , '' Brown said in Zoom press conference following Monday 's first day of practice . `` I saw it just like you did . '' `` It '' was what has come to be the #WeWantToPlay movement that had Clemson quarterback Trevor Lawrence at its forefront . `` Our team wants to play . Our coaches want to coach , '' Brown said . `` I think that 's an important voice to be out there . A lot of our guys were part of that movement last night . I stayed up way later than I usually want to because I was moved not only by the actions of our guys but players across college football . '' We have entered an age where college football players are speaking their minds after decades of being mindless lemmings who followed whatever their coaches and their schools told them to . They have become activists in their own lives at a time when the world has been changed through a virus and social injustice with social media giving them a means to unite and speak out to themselves and to the people who follow their sport . `` I thought it was pretty neat , '' Brown said of the budding movement that even now has caught the attention of President Trump . `` I 'm in the group that believes we need football and I think we can do it in a safe environment . I respect the virus , but we can lean from it . '' Clemson 's Lawrence is the perfect cover boy for the movement for he is in it even though he probably needs it less than any other , expected to be a high NFL draft choice whether there is a season or no He put forth a series of Tweets on Sunday : I do n't know about y’ all but we want to play . #WeWantToPlay Let 's work together where we can put together a situation where we can play the game that all of us love . Not divide and argue . There is a way forward . And then he put forth a movement statement with the logos of the Power 5 conferences : We all want to play football this season . Establish universal mandated health and safety procedures and protocols to protect college against Covid-19 among all conferences throughout the NCAA . Give players the opportunity to opt out and respect their decision . Guarantee eligibility whether a player chooses to play this season or not . Use our voices to establish open communication & trust between players and officials ; ultimately create a college football players association representative of the players of all 5 Power Conferences . It did n't take long before President Trump retweeted Lawrence 's Tweet with the hashtag . He then offered up a couple of other Tweets : The student-athletes have worked too hard for their season to be cancelled . #WeWantToPlay And then Arkansas athletic director Hunter Yurachek came out backing the movement , just as Brown is now doing along with many others . `` It 's important the players have an opportunity to express themselves , '' Brown said . There has been open conversation between West Virginia playes and coaches . `` We give them that . They ask questions , '' Brown said The questions they ask of the coaches are more about eligibility than safety . `` What if only five games are played ? '' `` What happens if you do n't have a redshirt ? '' But they also ask questions and express views to other players , those on their teams and those elsewhere through social media and Brown is for that . `` The world has shrunk . Players talk , '' he said . `` They have a greater appreciation of how we are going about this . '' He understands how much the game means to himself , therefore Brown also understands what it means to others and he is convinced the right route to follow is to play football . `` If they are not playing football are they getting tested twice a week ? '' he asked . `` Are they safer working out here or at a local high school or gym . And these are active kids , they will go work out . Well , absolutely they are safer here . We have experts int he field working with them . Their training can be at a higher level . '' And , while peer pressure is often cited as being reasons for them to break protocol , to head downtown and to party , peer pressure also can work to have them follow protocol and do what is best for the team , the city , the state and themselves . Football is what brought most of them to West Virginia . It is what many expect to consume their lives , either as professional players or in the coaching profession . It is not a passion as much as a route to success or something needed simply to fulfill their ego . True , a number of players across the country have opted out of playing this year , worrying about the virus , about it hurting their professional chances ... but the movement in the Power 5 conferences is strong and it is just beginning . Brown , like everyone else , is caught in Nowhereland , though .

'' `` It 's the story of Mowgli , the man-cub , who has been raised in the jungle by Baloo , the bear , and Bagheera , the panther , '' said Lambert . `` Unfortunately , a new threat has arisen as Shere Khan , the tiger , has returned to the jungle after many years away . He does not like Mowgli and the animals , with the help of the audience , try to outwit Shere Khan . '' This show has been a fun one for the company 's actors . `` We have actors who have n't done animals and they are enjoying it but saying that it 's hard , '' Lambert said . '' We 've spent a great deal of time in rehearsals studying footage of their animals and learning to create animal sounds and discovering how that animal would move when played by a human . '' Concessions will be available and have been adapted to comply with safety guidelines . `` We are excited to be able to open . We are family-owned and operated and we value the healthy of our people and the health of our audiences more than anything , '' Lambert said . `` We have made a lot of choices to make sure everyone stays safe and we hope we can provide people a chance to enjoy some time to escape and unwind .

Muscle spasms can occur anywhere , but the lower extremities are most commonly inflicted , Giordano adds -- which brings us back to that rogue calf . He stresses the importance of stopping what you 're doing immediately -LRB- especially during a workout ! -RRB- to avoid further injuries before following his tips . `` Simply hold a gentle stretch until it resolves . Do not forcefully stretch , as that may cause more pain . A light massage to the muscle area of the cramp may also help . '' A percussive massage device like a Theragun , a Hypervolt , or a foam roller can come in handy during these moments , too -- just do n't put too much pressure on the area , Giordano says . And always remember to speak to a doctor when experiencing pain -- especially if your muscle spasms occur often and are accompanied by shooting nerve pain and numbness . Taking preventative measures could help decrease your chances of getting muscle spasms , too . Giordano suggests warming up with dynamic stretches before exercising , drinking plenty of water , managing your fitness workload , and cooling down after sweat sessions .

'' It makes sense : The repetitive impact of running can be tough on your lower body , and running has long had a bad rap when it comes to knee injuries . But running on its own is n't as bad for the knees as people previously thought . Runners who logged the most mileage in a study published in the journal Arthritis Care & Research actually had less knee pain than the other participants . That said , `` the knee is the anchor of our running gait , thus taking on the brunt of the impact with every step of our run , '' says Bethann Wittig , an RRCA-certified running coach , NASM-certified personal trainer , and Fitness and Personal Training Coordinator at Rutgers University . Knee injuries are still common -- they account for 28 percent of injuries in runners , according to recent data published in the Journal of Sports Science and Medicine . `` The most common knee injuries are overuse injuries : too much distance , intensity , frequency , or a significant change in terrain that overstresses the tissues around the knee , '' says Ben Reuter , Ph.D. , C.S.C.S. , author of Developing Endurance . And given its location halfway between your hip and your foot , your knee is susceptible to problems in both areas . That 's why `` strengthening the muscles that surround our knees is key to stability and injury prevention , '' says Wittig . `` The knee is involved in the full running gait cycle : When we flex it , the hamstrings contract ; to extend it , the quadriceps come into play . All of these interconnected muscles need to be strengthened in order to protect that knee . '' When there are weakness or imbalances in those muscles , it can lead to issues like runner 's knee , or pain under your kneecap -LRB- which accounts for approximately 25 percent of running-related injuries , according to research from Orthopedic Reviews -RRB- ; patellar tendinitis , or pain below your kneecap and at the top of your shin ; and iliotibial band syndrome , or pain on the side of your knee . Your knee is n't working independently from the rest of your body , so a consistent , whole body resistance training program is important for strengthening all your muscles , so they can withstand not just the repetitive muscle contractions or running , but also be better able to absorb the forces that come with each foot strike , says Reuter . How to use this list : Wittig and Reuter both recommend incorporating knee-strengthening exercises twice a week to get the full benefits . If you 're feeling any knee pain , take a day or two off of running and do these moves instead . If you 're looking to use them as a preventative workout , perform this workout on an easy running day or rest day . Start with your body weight and then add weight once you 're feeling confident with your form . Perform each exercise for the reps and sets listed . They are demonstrated by certified personal trainers so you can learn the perfect form . You will need a towel and a resistance band . Squat How to do it : Stand with feet just wider than hip-width apart , toes pointed slightly out , and hands clasped at chest . Sending hips back , then bend knees to lower down as far as possible while keeping your chest lifted . You should lower down until thighs are at least parallel to floor . Press through heels and engage glutes to return back to the starting position . Repeat . Do 3 sets of 10 reps. Why it works : `` A squat is a compound movement that strengthens the knee by focusing on large lower body muscles : the quadriceps , hamstrings , and glutes , '' says Wittig . This move helps improve knee mobility and strength . Reverse Towel Lunge How to do it : Stand with feet hip-width apart with a towel or slider under right foot . Slide right foot back as you bend left knee , allowing left hip to flex , and lowering left knee to floor . Press left heel into the floor , then drive upwards to return to standing . Do 1 to 2 sets of 8 to 10 reps on each side . Why it works : Reverse lunges focus on balance and stability through the knee joint . `` They 're great for the knee because your front leg remains safely anchored while the exercise improves stability with the unilateral movement , '' explains Wittig . Single-Leg Deadlift How to do it : Stand with feet hip-width apart . Lift right foot just off of the floor , making sure not to let right hip shift out to the side . With a microbend in left knee , hinge at hips as right leg lifts straight out behind you and lower chest toward the ground . Continue until chest and right leg are nearly parallel to the floor in a straight line . Pause , then squeeze glutes to return back to starting position . Do 1 to 2 sets of 8 to 10 reps on each leg . Why it works : Single-leg deadlifts improve stability and strength through the posterior chain -LRB- your back , hips , glutes , and hamstrings -RRB- -- which will protect the knee joint -- as well your core and ankles . `` Single-leg exercises work your balance , are specific to running , and are less likely to overload the body , '' says Reuter . Lateral Monster Walk How to do it : Loop a resistance band around your ankles . Starting with the feet shoulder-width apart and the knees slightly bent , take 15 steps to the right , then 15 steps to the left . That 's 1 set . Move slowly , stepping wide enough to feel the band 's resistance , and think about pushing the knees out -LRB- rather than allowing them to collapse inward -RRB- . Complete 2 to 3 sets of 30 total reps. Why it works : You 'll feel these in your glutes -- specifically the gluteus medius , which helps stabilize your hips and pelvis while running , which is important for equal transmission of forces from the heel through the knee to the spine during training , says Wittig . `` Glute activation is shown to reduce the rate of knee injuries , '' she adds . Lateral Lunge How to do it : Start in a standing position , then step to your left foot way out to the left , send hips back and bend left knee until hamstring is about parallel to the floor as right leg stays straight . Push off the right foot and return to the starting position , then repeat on the left . Complete 20 total reps , alternating legs . Do 1 to 2 sets . Why it works : Runners move in the sagittal plane -LRB- forward and back -RRB- , but training in all planes of motion decreases the risk of overuse injuries , says Wittig . `` Lateral lunges train the frontal -LRB- or side to side -RRB- plane of motion while strengthening the muscles around the knee , '' she explains . They also `` put less direct load on the knee joint compared to traditional squats and lunges . '' Step Up How to do it : Stand in front of a step or bench . Step up with right foot , then drive the left knee up toward your chest so hip and knee form a 90-degree angle . Return to start . That 's one rep. Do 8 reps on each side . Repeat for 3 sets total . Add a set of dumbbells for an extra challenge as you progress . Why it works : Another compound movement , step ups -- when controlled with a slow lowering -LRB- or eccentric -RRB- movement -- are key for building deceleration of the leg for the running gait cycle , says Wittig . `` This is the job of the posterior chain , including the knee joint , '' she explains . Split Squat How to do it : Stand a foot or two in front of a bench , box , or step . Reach right foot back and place the toes on the bench . Bend left knee to lower as far as you can with control . Push through left foot to return to standing . Do 2 or 3 sets of 8 to 10 reps per leg . Why it works : This kind of resistance training for the knee and hip joints moves you beyond the range of motion that you generally move through while running while challenging your stability and strengthening your lower leg muscles , says Reuter .

The latest addition to the trail brings it closer than ever to Meadville 's Bicentennial Park , stretching about a mile from the Bean 's Auto Service trailhead underneath Smock Bridge , then behind the J.M. Smucker Co. plant and all the way to Mary Gable Park , wedged between the end of Shippen Street and French Creek in Kerrtown . The volunteers responsible for the trail call the newest part the `` connector '' since it will someday in the not-too-distant future link the trail with the city . The `` connector '' is not quite complete , according to Dick Eglinton , president of French Creek Recreational Trails , the nonprofit that maintains the trail . The final topping of fine limestone dust is expected to be added as soon as October , Eglinton said , and drainage features will be added as well . In the meantime , however , the new section of trail is open for hikers and bikers . The long-term goal remains the same as it has been since Calvin Ernst , president of Ernst Conservation Seeds , donated the former Bessemer & Lake Erie Railroad Co. right-of-way for use as a bike trail in 1996 : to create a walkable and rideable trail that connects the city of Meadville and the borough of Conneaut Lake . `` We 're all volunteers , so it depends on our energy level , '' Eglinton said of imminent plans to stretch the trail further toward Conneaut Lake from its current western terminus at Bailey Road , `` but we 're making good progress . '' Like the rest of the trail , the new connector has hosted much more traffic over the spring and summer due to the coronavirus pandemic , according to Eglinton . It also provides a useful alternative route for bikers in the area . `` You do n't have to ride over Smock Bridge , which is perilous , '' Eglinton said . FCRT Vice President Ed Easley said the group was pleased to have provided pedestrians another route . `` A lot of people do n't like going across the sidewalk on Smock Bridge , '' Easley said . Ernst trail , in contrast , is `` safer and a little more scenic way to go over there . '' The scenes visible from the trail range from the industrial -- an underside view of the bridge that drivers most often see from above -- to the natural . Easley 's favorite part of the new connector section is where it curves closely alongside French Creek and a wetlands area near the third of four new footbridges as the trail stretches north between the creek and Park Avenue Plaza . `` The new part does come a little closer to French Creek , '' Easley said . `` We hope that 's a good way to help people enjoy the natural surroundings . '' Near the opposite end of the trail at Bailey Road , Ernst Farms LLC purchased additional railroad right-of-way as well as several parcels of adjoining land late last year and early this year . Calvin Ernst said he has already discussed connecting the trail along the rail bed to nearby South Watson Run Road . Use of the rail bed will allow the trail to avoid going around the swampy areas near the Bailey Road trailhead , according to Ernst . `` We 're trying to make it better , '' Ernst said , citing optimism among FCRT officials about eventually extending the trail to Conneaut Lake . `` That 's in the future a little bit . I guess we 're making it one foot at a time . '' Since his company owned land extending along both sides of the defunct rail bed that became the central section of the trail , Ernst said purchasing the right-of-way was an easy decision . Converting it into a public trail `` was in everybody 's interest , '' he added . Today , Ernst is not often among the large numbers of pedestrians and bikers who have been taking advantage of the opportunity offered by his namesake trail to get some exercise and enjoy nature while maintaining one 's distance from others . `` I get about 5 miles of walking in a day just in walking around the facility and looking at fields and stuff like that , so I do n't really have to get on the asphalt , '' Ernst said .

It 's through her life long dedication to the cause that she is now the newest inductee into the Iowa Women 's Hall of Fame . Ione Genevieve Shadduck was born on October 28 , 1923 , in Mattoon , Wisconsin but currently lives in West Des Moines . Growing up on an 80-acre farm , she attended a one-room school -LRB- a two-mile walk -RRB- that had grades first through eighth . In her first job at an electric company , she experienced her first discrimination as a woman when she requested equal pay and was refused . She quit and became a `` Rosie the Riveter '' as a tester of steel drums . When World War II ended , so did that job . Being bored with secretarial work , she wanted to serve her country , so she joined the Women 's Army Corps in May 1949 and served during the Korean conflict . Under the GI Bill , Ione pursued her BS degree at the University of Wisconsin , majoring in Physical Education . This was the beginning of her advocacy efforts of fighting for women athletes to be able to compete in sports , travel to other colleges , mix their teams , and just have fun under the `` Women 's Recreational Association '' program . After a few years of teaching , she decided to pursue her master 's degree and then her PhD at Michigan State University . Ever mindful of the imbalance of opportunities , she noted that the best assistant-ships went to male students . As Ione was completing her PhD , she was recruited by Drake University to head the Women 's Physical Education Program . She soon encountered the tradition of the girls ' basketball program in Iowa , which was celebrated by sold-out crowds in Vets Auditorium . As Iowa and Oklahoma were the only states that still played six-player -LRB- half court -RRB- basketball , Ione knew that Iowa players would be at a disadvantage and did not have the necessary experience in the five-player game to compete for scholarships to play at the college level . She was one of the professionals that lobbied and advocated for the transition to five-player girls basketball in Iowa . As structural changes were taking place at Drake related to her program , Ione worked with leaders to create a coordinated program for which she was trained and wanted to lead . This ended as another experience in which a male was then given the position . She decided to file a discrimination complaint against the university , redirected her focus and at the encouragement of a member of the law school staff , she enrolled in Drake Law School . The female law students in her class experienced resentment from male students who were fighting for the slots the women filled in the quota system . She passed the Iowa Bar exam the first time she took it in January 1977 and prepared to embark on a new career . Ione initiated the practice of hiring expert witnesses on economics to testify on the value of the economic contribution of a homemaker to a marriage in divorce cases . Eventually , others began to see the value of this type of testimony . During her years as an attorney , she appeared before the Iowa Supreme Court on a 1983 case that set the precedent on joint custody . Her argument for joint custody based on the need for the child to continue contact with the mother and father was in the `` best interest of the child . '' As more women became attorneys , Ione decided they needed to organize , support women 's role in law , and help promote women attorneys . She was a founding member of the Iowa Women Attorneys Association . Additionally as an attorney , she served for 12 years at the Iowa Civil Rights Commission . She was a member of the Governor 's committee to remove sexism from the Iowa Code . She also served many communities as Administrative Law Judge .

For five decades , the former first lady of Indiana has been a relatable leader , hands-on preservationist and vocal champion for the value of historic places . She helped launch the Indiana Main Street program , played an instrumental role in saving individual meaningful structures , engaged countless Hoosiers in preservation efforts , and produced an award-winning TV series demonstrating the impact preservation can have on communities . O'Bannon was introduced to preservation when she and husband Frank moved to Corydon in 1957 and fixed up their third-floor apartment in the nineteenth-century building that housed The Corydon Democrat , a newspaper owned by the O'Bannon family 108 years . Not long after , Judy met Reid Williamson -- the then-president of Indiana Landmarks for whom the Williamson Prize is named -- and together they helped launch the Indiana Main Street program , which touts historic preservation as an important ingredient in revitalizing downtowns . Judy also helped found the Indiana Main Street Council and chaired it for a decade . She continued to show her passion for preservation after Frank was elected Indiana 's lieutenant governor in 1989 , when the O'Bannons purchased and continued renovation of a late Victorian house in Indianapolis 's Old Northside neighborhood . Attending services at the Central Avenue United Methodist Church just blocks away from their home , Judy stepped up when the dwindling congregation struggled to maintain its house of worship and led the charge that spawned the Old Centrum , a hub for nonprofit agencies that was housed there for many years . She helped save the building again in 2008 , supporting Indiana Landmarks ' plan to restore the church as its headquarters and helping engage Bill and Gayle Cook of Bloomington in efforts to restore the structure . Judy also served as a media force for historic preservation , participating in three notable programs for Indianapolis PBS station WFYI : the documentary Transformation , which chronicled the Old Centrum 's conversion to the Indiana Landmarks Center ; the Emmy award-winning series Community Building Communities ; and Second Chances : What Can Happen When a Barn Lives Again , a documentary that drew on her own experiences to showcase barns adapted to new uses . Even as Indiana 's first lady , Judy made her mark on historic properties : Hosting guests at the Governor 's Residence on Meridian Street in the late '90s , she helped raise $ 900,000 in private donations to make the landmark residence accessible to all . As a result of her experience , Indiana Landmarks tapped her expertise for a task force studying how to make the organization 's landmark properties more accessible .

According to Facebook 's `` Why am I seeing this ad '' pop-up , when the agency purchased the ad , it asked Facebook to not show it to anyone over 54 years of age . And they asked Facebook to show it specifically to people who have `` African American multicultural affinity . '' Facebook , apparently , complied . The problem ? Federal law prohibits employers from discriminating on the basis of age and race , including in advertising open jobs . When The Markup brought the ad to Facebook 's attention , the company took it down , according to Tom Channick , a Facebook spokesperson . -LRB- Tenderness 's CEO , Julio Fernandez , did n't respond to The Markup 's requests for comment . -RRB- This is not the first time Facebook has been accused of allowing discrimination on its platform . Civil rights groups have accused Facebook of violating federal antidiscrimination laws and filed at least five lawsuits against the company , which culminated in a landmark settlement last year . In it , Facebook agreed to change its practices that enabled advertisers to exclude people of certain genders , ages , and `` multicultural affinities '' from seeing housing , job , and financial services ads . -LRB- Facebook does not collect data on users ' race but did until recently have a `` multicultural affinity '' category , which it did not clearly define . -RRB- The company is still defending another lawsuit , filed by federal housing authorities . The bulk of the legal issues centered on the way much of online advertising works , including Facebook 's . Unlike many print ads and early internet ads , which appeared next to related content , Facebook 's advertising targets people . Facebook 's detailed data trove on its users allows companies advertising everything from jobs to jeans to choose from a sprawling menu of demographic characteristics and interests when choosing who sees their ads -- and that has earned the company billions of dollars year after year . Facebook has defended that practice , arguing that companies might legitimately use age-based targeting to tailor their messages or for outreach to underrepresented groups . Its written policies ban discrimination , it has said . And targeting can sometimes be innocuous . A 21-plus hip-hop venue in Atlanta might have good reasons to not want to spend money advertising to 18-year-olds , people living in New York , or people whose online behavior reveals no interest in hip-hop . But there are circumstances where targeting an advertisement based on a person 's characteristics is illegal . Federal laws prohibit discrimination in housing , employment , and financial services -- including in housing advertisements in particular . These regulations were imposed after decades of landlords and neighborhoods banning minority and immigrant renters and homeowners ; employers discriminating based on race , gender , and sexuality ; and creditors selling minorities bad loan rates and financial products . `` Helping prevent discrimination in employment opportunity ads is an area where we lead the industry , '' the Facebook spokesperson , Channick , said in an email . So why was The Markup still able to find a discriminatory job ad ? Channick would n't say . The company uses automated controls to limit when and how advertisers can target ads based on age and gender , in line with its civil settlement . Channick did n't respond to a question about whether Facebook 's automated controls always work . Facebook had forbidden the use of `` multicultural '' categories for targeting in job ads . But those categories were used by other kinds of ads by civil and voting rights groups , Black-focused health advocacy groups , politicians on both sides of the aisle , and commercial advertisers . A week after The Markup contacted Facebook , Facebook announced it was eliminating the multicultural affinity categories altogether after years of internal debate . Aside from allowing advertisers to target specific audiences , some critics say Facebook discriminates all on its own in delivering those ads . That 's what the Department of Housing and Urban Development argues in its lawsuit . Once an advertiser picks its target audience , Facebook 's algorithm makes its own decisions about which specific user within the target audience to show an ad to . The goal of that algorithm , Facebook has said , is to try to predict which people might be interested in the ad , based on their Facebook activity and the demographics it can pull from their personal pages -- including age , gender , and other factors . For pretty much all the types of credit ads that we 've analyzed , men tend to be a greater percentage -LSB- of the people shown the ad -RSB- . Sara Kingsley , Carnegie Mellon University `` Facebook is not giving the user what the user wants -- Facebook is giving the user what it thinks a demographic stereotype wants , '' wrote the Lawyers ' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law in a court filing . In 2019 , researchers at Northeastern University and the digital civil rights advocacy group Upturn ran dozens of their own ads , all targeted to the same broad audience , and found that Facebook showed the ads seeking to hire secretaries mostly to women . It 's not clear whether Facebook programmed its algorithms to show the secretary job ad to any given woman because she herself did something to express an interest in secretarial work , or simply because she was a woman . A team at Carnegie Mellon University recently analyzed real-life ads for things like jobs , housing , and credit that were included -LRB- sometimes by mistake -RRB- in Facebook 's publicly available archive of political ads . The ads were posted both before and after Facebook 's policy change . `` For pretty much all the types of credit ads that we 've analyzed , '' said Sara Kingsley , a Ph.D. student who led that research , `` men tend to be a greater percentage '' of the people shown the ad . Housing and job ads , she said , went disproportionately to women . But individual ads can vary widely : Things that Facebook may consider innocuous data points may correlate so strongly with age or gender or race that `` the algorithm sees the circumstances of older black women , which are the result of systemic discrimination and inequity , and misinterprets those circumstances as preferences , '' David Brody , an attorney at the Lawyers ' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law , said in an email . `` So the next time the algorithm encounters a user matching the qualities of an older black woman , it is going to impute those so-called preferences on to that user and in the process reinforce the pattern of systemic discrimination , '' he said . Facebook 's 2019 settlement with civil rights groups required it to implement new rules , like requiring advertisers to click a button to self-report housing , job , and credit ads . Facebook then removes certain demographic targeting choices from that ad 's menu of options . And Facebook began requiring advertisers to accept an agreement promising not to discriminate . The company also promised to research bias in its algorithms . But researchers and civil rights activists say that they 're frustrated the company has n't released any findings . One internal study reportedly found bias against users who had been categorized as matching the African American `` multicultural affinity '' category . Facebook made adjustments but shut down further research because that category was not supposed to represent race -- data that Facebook did n't gather from its users . `` They have chosen not to collect that data because they do n't want to turn on the lights and see how many cockroaches are in the room , '' Brody said . Just a few weeks ago , Facebook created teams to study racial bias on its platforms . California law bans `` intentional '' discrimination in places of `` public accommodation , '' including on websites . A pending lawsuit in federal court in Northern California argues that Facebook 's ads break that law because the algorithms ' outcomes treat people differently based on characteristics like age and gender . `` Look , they wrote the algorithm , '' Brody told The Markup . `` No one knows how the algorithm works except them . They are responsible for everything the algorithm does . '' -LRB- Facebook declined to comment on the lawsuit , but in court filings , it has denied breaking the law . -RRB- Look , they wrote the algorithm ... . They are responsible for everything the algorithm does . David Brody , Lawyers ' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law Federal laws also ban discrimination , but federal law also protects tech companies like Facebook from liability over the content on their platforms -- specifically Section 230 -LRB- c -RRB- of the Communications Decency Act , which in essence says websites are n't responsible for things other people say on their sites . Facebook 's legal response to the public accommodation lawsuit in California invokes Section 230 -- essentially saying the company ca n't be sued over ads on its platform -- a legal question that has not yet been settled . Senator Mark Warner , a Democrat , in a statement sent to The Markup , called Facebook 's argument in fighting the public accommodation lawsuit a `` misuse of Section 230 .

ADAM SHAPIRO : The other thing we are watching today has to do with the reaction to social media and what some people are concerned with might be fake news or misrepresentations of what is actually happening in the -- out there . You know about the boycott with Facebook . You have several companies , including our parent company Verizon , saying they 're going to withhold advertising from Facebook until it gets on top of the issues there . And then over the weekend , we heard from Starbucks and Levi 's also joining , as Facebook , now 180 companies boycotting them . And joining us to discuss this is Beth Egan , an associate professor of advertising at Syracuse University , my alma mater . I beat her to the graduation line , though . You are also an alumni . Good to have you here , Beth BETH EGAN : Thank you , Adam , for having me . ADAM SHAPIRO : So from an advertising standpoint , what we keep hearing from analysts is that look , this is $ 70 billion a year in revenue for Facebook and the 118 companies that are boycotting , not yet a serious threat . But the potential is that this could go global , right ? BETH EGAN : Yes , absolutely . And a couple of the companies that have announced over the weekend have extended it to a global boycott . ADAM SHAPIRO : So what does that mean for Facebook , for their bottom line do you think ? Do you expect the company and for that matter , other social media platforms to respond to this ? BETH EGAN : Well , they 're absolutely going to have to respond . But I think the one thing you have to keep in mind , especially for Facebook , is the $ 70 billion in revenue , only 6 % of that revenue comes from their top 100 advertisers , according to Pathmatics . Really the crux of the Facebook advertising gain is that small business owner . So while these are substantial and important moves by these large companies , still not having a major effect on the Facebook ad revenue projections or , quite frankly , Mark Zuckerberg 's net worth either .", "seg_content_paragraph_starts": "0 28 134 180 192 248 275 313", "simhash": "51157cfdf2821606d979eeefaafffac4", "spacy_content_loc": [], "spacy_content_num": ["180", "$ 70 billion", "118", "one", "$ 70 billion", "only 6 %", "100"], "spacy_content_org": ["Syracuse University", "Yahoo Finance 's", "Facebook", "Facebook", "Verizon", "Facebook", "Starbucks", "Levi", "Facebook", "Syracuse University", "Facebook", "Facebook", "Facebook", "Pathmatics", "Facebook", "Facebook"], "spacy_content_otr": [], "spacy_content_per": ["Beth Egan", "ADAM SHAPIRO", "Beth Egan", "Beth BETH EGAN", "Adam", "ADAM SHAPIRO", "BETH EGAN", "ADAM SHAPIRO", "BETH EGAN", "Mark Zuckerberg 's"], "spacy_content_tim": ["today", "the weekend", "the weekend"], "spacy_title_loc": [], "spacy_title_num": [], "spacy_title_org": ["Facebook", "Syracuse University Associate"], "spacy_title_otr": [], "spacy_title_per": [], "spacy_title_tim": [], "text_category": {}, "title_c_count": 16, "tpc_m": {"t885": 0.10421229153871536, "t378": 0.13649240136146545}, "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/video/small-businesses-may-difficult-join-163332659.html"}

Microsoft is one of those companies where they launched the Surface Pro X back in 2019 . However , it seems that despite it being a newer device , it appears that Geekbench listings have revealed that Apple 's Mac Mini powered by the A12Z Bionic chipset has managed to outperform it . In case you 're wondering why this matters , it is because Apple has recently announced their plans to eventually transition to ARM-based chipsets for their Mac computers and move away from using Intel processors . Naturally this has resulted in many wondering why well these ARM-based Macs will perform , and these benchmarks are looking pretty promising . According to the Geekbench results , the Mac Mini with the A12Z chipset scored 811 and 2,871 on the single-core and multi-core tests respectively , whereas the Surface Pro X managed 726 and 2,831 respectively . While not exactly blazing ahead , it should be noted that the A12Z is based on a 2-year old chipset , whereas the Microsoft Surface Pro X uses a newer chipset . Also , given that the Mac Mini Developer Transition Kit is relying on Rosetta 2 to test their apps , it means that performance , in theory , should be much better once these apps have been optimized properly for the A12Z . While there are other factors to consider instead of performance , at the very least it seems that on paper , Apple 's plans to move away from Intel seems to hold a lot of promise .

lake , authorities said Monday . Authorities went door to door in the aftermath of Sunday night 's fire , which jumped palm trees in the town Niland amid high winds . Imperial County said fire officials recovered one dead body , without elaborating on the person 's identity . Crews extinguished hot spots Monday after the fire was contained , according to the county health department . By afternoon , power was restored to 414 customers , while 91 were still without it . The cause of the blaze was under investigation . Niland is an economically depressed town of about 1,000 people in a desolate stretch of a county that regularly registers one of the highest unemployment rates in the United States . The county 's jobless rate stood at 27.8 % in May . It lies near Bombay Beach , a community that doubles to about 500 people during winter and has an apocalyptic feel . Utility poles and trailer debris that were flooded a few years ago are now exposed because the Salton Sea shrank . The Salton Sea was created n 1905 when the Colorado River breached a dike and flooded for two years , bringing farm settlers to the Imperial Valley in California 's southeast corner . California 's largest lake by surface area soon became a desert playground . A 1951 regatta boasted 21 world records . Celebrities including Frank Sinatra , Bing Crosby , the Beach Boys , Jerry Lewis , the Marx Brothers and Desi Arnaz flocked to the lake . The `` Salton Riviera '' rivaled nearby Palm Springs and attracted more tourists than Yosemite National Park . Tropical storms in 1976 and 1977 destroyed marinas and resorts , triggering a prolonged economic decline . Environmental catastrophes , rising salinity and a receding shoreline caused tourism to plummet . The Niland area draws retirees and some tourists . It is near a large , colorful sculpture called `` Salvation Mountain , '' which is painted with Christian sayings and Bible verses . `` Slab City , '' also nearby , is a scattered collection of off-the-grid dwellings on an abandoned military site .", "seg_content_paragraph_starts": "0 38 82 126 169 212 258 310 341", "simhash": "b7d32860d3d399216e69bdde5b71e2de", "spacy_content_loc": ["Calif.", "Salton Sea", "California", "Niland", "Imperial County", "the United States", "Bombay Beach", "Salton Sea", "The Salton Sea", "Colorado River", "the Imperial Valley", "California", "California", "Palm Springs", "Yosemite National Park", "Niland"], "spacy_content_num": ["one", "about 40", "one", "414", "91", "about 1,000", "one", "27.8 %", "about 500", "21"], "spacy_content_org": ["NILAND", "AP", "Niland", "Desi", "Christian"], "spacy_content_otr": ["the Beach Boys", "`` Salvation Mountain", "Bible"], "spacy_content_per": ["Frank Sinatra", "Bing Crosby", "Jerry Lewis", "Marx Brothers", "Arnaz"], "spacy_content_tim": ["Monday", "Sunday night 's", "Monday", "afternoon", "May", "winter", "a few years ago", "1905", "two years", "1951", "1976", "1977"], "spacy_title_loc": ["California"], "spacy_title_num": ["1", "40"], "spacy_title_org": [], "spacy_title_otr": [], "spacy_title_per": [], "spacy_title_tim": [], "text_category": {}, "title_c_count": 12, "tpc_m": {"t119": 0.16502290964126587}, "url": "https://www.nhregister.com/news/article/Brush-fire-kills-1-ruins-40-homes-in-California-15375228.php"}

At some point next year , Hoffman will step up to ceo of the $ 2.3 billion Wolverine , while continuing as president . The precise timing is to be determined depending on the needs of the company . Hoffman will succeed Blake Krueger , currently president , ceo and chairman , through what officials described as an orderly transition period . Hoffman is also joining the Wolverine board . David Stefko , Vince Holding 's executive vice president and chief financial officer , has been named interim ceo , succeeding Hoffman . The board and a search firm will seek a permanent ceo for the $ 375.2 million company , which operates the Rebecca Taylor and Parker brands as well as Vince . Hoffman 's extensive experience in retail , wholesale and digital channels was a critical factor in recruiting him to Wolverine , primarily a wholesale and e-commerce business with an array of branded casual , active , work , outdoor sport , athletic , children 's and uniform footwear and apparel . Hoffman 's last experience running a contemporary women 's business also presents Wolverine with an opportunity to bring more fashion into a business that 's dominated by footwear . In an interview Tuesday , Hoffman said he plans to buy a home in the Grand Rapids area near Wolverine headquarters in Rockford , Mich. . Wolverine also has headquarters in Boston due to its acquisition of the PLG group from Collective Brands Inc. in 2010 , which brought the Sperry , Saucony , Stride Rite and Keds brands into the Wolverine Worldwide family of brands . The portfolio also includes Merrell , Hush Puppies , Wolverine , Chaco , Bates and Hytest . In addition , the company is the global footwear licensee of Cat and Harley-Davidson and it operates 97 stores , including 46 Merrell , 48 Sperry and three Saucony units . `` This is a great opportunity to combine both what I 've learned during my 25 years in department stores managing a portfolio of brands and categories , and the last five years leading a vertical brand , '' Hoffman told WWD . `` As a team , we will embrace a consumer direct mind-set while we forge even stronger connections between global consumers and our brands . '' As president , Hoffman will oversee the 12 brands in the Wolverine portfolio , as well as the digital and international businesses . `` Wolverine Worldwide speaks to a wide breadth of consumers , '' Hoffman noted . Krueger , Wolverine 's ceo and president since 2007 , said in a statement that Hoffman brings `` a valuable set of skills and experiences that will help our brands capitalize on the many opportunities that lie ahead . He brings a passion and strategic vision for consumer direct and omni-channel retail that is well-suited for the digital pivot and accelerated changes in consumer behavior now taking place in the global marketplace . '' Krueger said Hoffman 's appointment is the result of a multiyear succession and search process . At Vince , Hoffman grew the e-commerce and digital platforms ; adapted the supply chain to buy-now-wear-now trends , and extended the brand into home , handbags and special sizes , among other categories previously not offered . Prior to joining Vince in 2015 , Hoffman was president and ceo of the former Bon-Ton Stores Inc. and before that , president and ceo of Lord & Taylor . Earlier , as president and ceo of Neiman Marcus Direct in Dallas , he established the Neiman Marcus Group as a pioneer in luxury e-commerce . He helped grow neimanmarcus.com and launched bergdorfgoodman.com and horchow.com . Last week , Wolverine reported better-than-expected results for the second quarter , marked by strong liquidity . The company said cash flow initiatives coupled with better-than-expected revenue and profit in the quarter led to $ 116 million of operating cash flow . There was a loss per diluted share of $ 0.02 but on an adjusted basis , per share earnings were positive at $ 0.08 . Revenue was $ 349.1 million , down 38.6 percent . Owned e-commerce revenue grew 96 percent . `` Our brands excelled online , with nearly triple-digit owned e-commerce revenue growth , benefiting from strength in key product categories that are resonating with consumers and the digital capabilities we have invested in over the last several years , '' Krueger said last week . `` The acceleration of our digital direct offense , together with our diversified and agile business model , enabled the company to adapt to the rapidly changing marketplace and deliver positive earnings and exceptional cash flow in the quarter . We believe the company is positioned well to accelerate out of the current market downturn once the impact of the pandemic subsides .

Futch works for C.P. Deli and Convenience Store in Palatka . At the onset of the coronavirus outbreak in Florida , the store decided to expand its services and begin selling and delivering essential items for its customers . To publicize the service , Futch and a coworker got creative . `` We wanted to promote that we had more than just food , so we decided to make a little rap song and post it on our Facebook , '' she said . When the video was posted , the owner of CP Deli , Amber Wilkson said customers loved it and asked for another video . `` I think it 's great the girls are doing this . Morale is down for restaurants . You 're not open . You do n't have customers inside . It 's something fun for everyone to enjoy , '' Wilkson said . For the deli 's second video , employees decided to dance and so the Corona Dance Off was born . Niko 's Pizza was second to take on the challenge and now a total of 8 restaurants have joined in and made their own .

An analysis of viruses in the guts of healthy Westerners also showed that dips and peaks in the diversity of virus types between childhood and old age mirror bacterial changes over the course of the lifespan . The Gut Virome Database developed by Ohio State University scientists identifies 33,242 unique viral populations that are present in the human gut . -LRB- A collection of viruses like those in the human gut is called a virome . -RRB- This is not cause for alarm : Most viruses do n't cause disease . In fact , the more scientists learn about viruses , the more they see them as part of the human ecosystem -- suggesting viruses have potential to represent a new class of drugs that could fight disease-causing bacteria , especially those resistant to antibiotics . Better knowledge of viruses in the gut environment could even improve understanding of the gastrointestinal symptoms experienced by some of the sickest COVID-19 patients . The researchers plan to update the open-access database on a regular basis . `` We 've established a robust starting point to see what the virome looks like in humans , '' said study co-author Olivier Zablocki , a postdoctoral researcher in microbiology at Ohio State . `` If we can characterize the viruses that are keeping us healthy , we might be able to harness that information to design future therapeutics for pathogens that ca n't otherwise be treated with drugs . '' The study is published today -LRB- Aug. 24 -RRB- in the journal Cell Host & Microbe . Talk of the good and bad bacteria in the gut microbiome is commonplace these days , but viruses in the gut -- and everywhere -- are hard to detect because their genomes do n't contain a common signature gene sequence that bacteria genomes do . So much of the vast sequence space of viruses remains unexplored that it is often referred to as `` dark matter . '' For this work , the researchers started with data from 32 studies over about a decade that had looked at gut viruses in a total of 1,986 healthy and sick people in 16 countries . Using techniques to detect virus genomes , the team identified more than 33,000 different viral populations . `` We used machine learning on known viruses to help us identify the unknown viruses , '' said first author Ann Gregory , who completed this work while she was a graduate student at Ohio State . `` We were interested in how many types of viruses we could see in the gut , and we determined that by how many types of genomes we could see since we could n't visually see the viruses . '' Their analysis confirmed findings from smaller studies suggesting that though a few viral populations were shared within a subset of people , there is no core group of gut viruses common to all humans . A few trends were identified , however . In healthy Western individuals , age influences the diversity of viruses in the gut , which increases significantly from childhood to adulthood , and then decreases after age 65 . The pattern matches what is known about ebbs and flows of gut bacterial diversity with one exception : Infant guts with underdeveloped immune systems are teeming with a range of virus types , but few bacteria varieties . People living in non-Western countries had higher gut virus diversity than Westerners . Gregory said other research has shown that non-Western individuals who move to the United States or another Western country lose that microbiome diversity , suggesting diet and environment drive virome differences . -LRB- For example , the scientists found some intact plant viruses in the gut -- the only way for them to get there is through the diet . -RRB- Variations in viral diversity could also be seen in healthy versus sick participants in the 32 studies analyzed . `` A general rule of thumb for ecology is that higher diversity leads to a healthier ecosystem , '' Gregory said . `` We know that more diversity of viruses and microbes is usually associated with a healthier individual . And we saw that healthier individuals tend to have a higher diversity of viruses , indicating that these viruses may be potentially doing something positive and having a beneficial role . '' Almost all of the populations -- 97.7 percent -- were phages , which are viruses that infect bacteria . Viruses have no function without a host -- they drift in an environment until they infect another organism , taking advantage of its properties to make copies of themselves . The most-studied viruses kill their host cells , but scientists in the Ohio State lab in which Gregory and Zablocki worked have discovered more and more phage-type viruses that coexist with their host microbes and even produce genes that help the host cells compete and survive . The leader of that lab , senior study author Matthew Sullivan , has his sights set on `` phage therapy '' -- the 100-year-old idea of using phages to kill antibiotic-resistant pathogens or superbugs . `` Phages are part of a vast interconnected network of organisms that live with us and on us , and when broad-spectrum antibiotics are used to fight against infection , they also harm our natural microbiome , '' Sullivan said . `` We are building out a toolkit to scale our understanding and capabilities to use phages to tune disturbed microbiomes back toward a healthy state . `` Importantly , such a therapeutic should impact not only our human microbiome , but also that in other animals , plants and engineered systems to fight pathogens and superbugs . It could also provide a foundation for something we might have to consider in the world 's oceans to combat climate change . '' A professor of microbiology and civil , environmental and geodetic engineering , Sullivan has helped establish cross-disciplinary research collaborations at Ohio State to pursue this work . He recently founded and directs Ohio State 's new Center of Microbiome Science and co-directs the Infectious Diseases Institute 's Microbial Communities program . Zablocki noted that there is still a lot to learn about the functions of viruses in the gut -- both beneficial and harmful . `` I see it as the chicken and the egg , '' he said . `` We see the disease and we see the community structure . Was it because of this community structure that the disease occurred , or is the disease causing the community structure that we see ? This standardized dataset will enable us to pursue those questions .

Scientists took a closer look at the effects of SARS-CoV-2 -- the Corona virus that causes `` Covid-19 '' -- through a powerful microscope at the National Institutes of Health in the United States and the University of Freiburg , Germany . They revealed that the virus makes the infected cells grow pasta-like `` claws '' , to reach several cells that are still in good health nearby . The virus appears to be using these branching structures , called filopodia , as syringes to stimulate other cells and inject them with a viral load , according to a study published in the journal Cell . `` There are long chains that make holes in other cells and the virus passes through the tube from one cell to another , '' said Nivan Krogan , director of the Institute for Quantitative Biological Sciences at the University of California , San Francisco , and leader of an international group of scientists . `` Our hypothesis is that this process speeds up infection , '' Krojan said . Scientists have revealed that the method of infection via filopodia is largely unusual , because not many viruses do this . Those that do , like smallpox , do not cause cells to germinate many branches , and their structure differs from that of the new corona virus . Usually , small viral molecules simply `` dock '' onto larger cells , and `` hijack '' their functions . More than 9.8 million people were infected with `` Covid-19 '' worldwide , and about 495,000 people had died , according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University .", "seg_content_paragraph_starts": "0 3 36 78 142 197 212 281", "simhash": "5c043548f6cfb517b7715a52a18e564f", "spacy_content_loc": ["Pensacola", "the United States", "Germany", "San Francisco"], "spacy_content_num": ["More than 9.8 million", "about 495,000"], "spacy_content_org": ["the National Institutes of Health", "the University of Freiburg", "the Institute for Quantitative Biological Sciences", "the University of California", "Johns Hopkins University"], "spacy_content_otr": ["Cell"], "spacy_content_per": ["Nivan Krogan", "Krojan"], "spacy_content_tim": [], "spacy_title_loc": [], "spacy_title_num": [], "spacy_title_org": [], "spacy_title_otr": [], "spacy_title_per": [], "spacy_title_tim": [], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"Health": 0.9337246417999268}, "second_cat": {"Health_Other": 0.9337246417999268}}, "title_c_count": 18, "tpc_m": {"t388": 0.29833024740219116, "t201": 0.1818542629480362}, "url": "https://hardandsmart.net/2020/06/30/corona-virus-stimulates-infected-cells-to-release-evil-claws-to-spread-rapidly-throughout-the-body/"}

The city also plans to have a downtown ambassador program to encourage wearing masks during times when they expect high foot traffic . `` With MSU 's recent decision to require that masks be worn at all times both indoors and outside on campus , we decided it was prudent to expand that requirement to the outdoor public spaces in our downtown area for the protection of our community and businesses , '' said East Lansing City Manager George Lahanas . `` Wearing a mask is one of the simple things we can all do during this unprecedented time to help prevent the spread of this virus , so that we can stay safe to stay open .

In a show of support for the 20 or so protesters , Sheriff A.J. Smith , Apalachicola Mayor Kevin Begos and the Rev. Eric Zile , pastor of the city 's oldest house of worship , Trinity Episcopal Church , all joined the Monday evening march . Organized by Zachary Jones , the gathering began at the pavilion across from the community garden , where signs were created , and then wound past Chestnut Cemetery as it advanced to the city police department on U.S. 98 a few blocks away . Police Chief Bobby Varnes drove his truck at a distance , ensuring traffic safety for the entirely peaceful protest . `` This is not a political issue , it 's a human issue , '' said Carol Barfield , chair of the county 's Democratic Executive Committee , who helped promote the event . `` Walk equally , Love equally , and Live equally ! '' Included among the hand-drawn signs were two beautifully drawn caricatures created earlier by Melanie Humble - of George Floyd , whose death last month in Minneapolis , Minnesota at the hands of police sparked the nationwide protests , and of Ahmaud Arbery , an unarmed man who was shot and killed in Brunswick , Georgia in February in a confrontation with residents who alleged he had burglarized a home under construction in the neighborhood . The first protest to surface in the city took place on Friday evening downtown , as 25-year-old Peyton Aubin started off as a lone protester , carrying a Black Lives Matter sign at the intersection of U.S. 98 and Market Street . He was soon joined by Adria Valenzuela and her sister Ali , both college students in Columbus , Ohio , their younger brother Nico , a high school student in Port St. Joe , and their parents , Apalachicola residents Luis and Marcy Valenzuela . The gathering grew with the arrival of Apalachicola residents Rosa Tolliver , Myrtis Wynn and Kyle Bouington , an engineering student in college , and later Netta Hayward , Delores Croom and a smattering of others . Several drivers honked in support of the gathering , with few if any evidencing hostility . `` We live in our little bubble here in Apalachicola , '' said Aubin . `` And we forget about what 's going on in the rest of the world , and that we do care here in Apalachicola . `` I 'm just trying to speak up because I did n't see anybody else doing it , '' he said , holding aloft a handmade sign affixed to the back of a kayak paddle . `` We were getting together to do it and we saw him and we said ` let 's go , ''' said Hayward . A much larger gathering is slated for this Saturday , beginning at 9 a.m. at the corner of Market Street and U.S. 98 in downtown Apalachicola . Sponsored by H'COLA -LRB- Hillside Coalition of Laborers for Apalachicola -RRB- , the event is billed as a `` peaceful protest rally , '' with the poster reading `` Join H'COLA in leading the stand against police brutality , inequality and racism . '' Protesters are encouraged to wear masks and to exercise social distancing , and to bring their own signs , although campaign signs , hats and clothing are not welcome .

Speakers for the rally included comments by those affected by the vandalism and reactions by clergy , law enforcement officers , politicians and others . `` We gather here today to show that person or those people -LRB- responsible for the vandalism -RRB- that we will not stand for the destruction of our city 's property , '' said Bryce Dolan , who organized an effort to help clean up the property . `` We will not stand for the destruction of our private citizens ' property . If you 're like me , you saw those messages earlier this week and you were disgusted , disappointed in those messages . `` But for others , those messages were a threat -- a threat to their lives , to their livelihood , '' Dolan added . `` So , if you felt threatened by those messages , we want to tell you that your life matters , and the Clay Center Community will stand with you . '' Not new to Clay Center Erin Mellies said she decided to organize the rally to show where Clay Center stands when it comes to hate , in all of its forms , `` especially racist hate . '' She called the vandalism that occurred across the community in at least 15 locations `` a hate crime . '' Mellies , the mother of a young black man , said she has experienced racism toward her son and shared a candid example where a 6-year-old called her son the n-word when he was 6 . `` What 's even more difficult is when you call the school and the principal says , ` It 's just name-calling . ' No it 's not , '' Mellies said . `` I have two sons and only because the pigment of their skin is different and there is a slight variation in their genetic code , their experiences in this country will be vastly different . The conversations about safety I have with them will be different . The worries that keep me up at night wondering about their whereabouts and safety will be different . '' Mellies said despite that experience , she has loved this town since she moved here seven years ago . `` Clay Center is a community of progress , supporting improvements that keep our town alive and well ... This feeling of community we have , it offers a sense of support and safety . We know our neighbors care about us and our community . There are so many kind , good-hearted people here , but unfortunately that 's not enough , because there are things happening in our town that undermine all of this . When there are words and symbols of hate used to cowardly deface property , it creates a feeling of unease , uncertainty in the safety we once had in our town . '' Racism is not new to Clay Center , Mellies said . `` The use of hate language is not new to Clay Center , '' she said . `` Often when we witness racist behavior , we do n't say anything . We may change the subject , look the other way . We might make an excuse or minimize it . Sometimes we may not even recognize it , because we do n't see it , or we do n't know about it . '' And even though we do n't want to make a big deal about it , it is a big deal , Mellies said . She encouraged people in the community not to be silent when they see racism . `` Intentional and unintentional acts of racism are hurtful , harmful and traumatic , '' she said . `` And when it 's not called out , people of color are not going to feel safe in our community . '' We all matter Mellies shared words from Cassie Hayworth who said in a letter , `` I have watched Clay Center rally around each other like I have never seen before . This rally is another example of why I am proud to be part of our family/community . We lock arms around each other when some are weak , we stand firm in support when there is a need and today we stand . `` I am a woman . I am a black woman . I am most importantly a child of God , '' Hayworth said I do not see color , I see hearts . This is not an issue of standing up for only black lives , I see this is an issue for all lives . There are thousands of different opinions flooding social media and into our homes , but I am here to say every one of us , young and old , all ethnicities . We all matter . '' Hayworth said she too has experienced racism while living in Clay Center -- once in the last eight months since moving home . `` There have been many fabulous , wonderful days when I have been welcomed and loved by hundreds of Clay Center folks that have loved me and my children without any question , '' Hayworth added . `` I want you to know , I believe my family is safe in Clay Center . I am black and I am not afraid . The vandalism that took place was an act of intimidation . I will not bow down in fear , nor will I respond with hate or anger . Whoever tagged these properties , they are hurting . They are being deceived in trying to cause division in our community ; and in reality they have brought us all together . They have given us a reason to teach and educate and support all . '' Hayworth asked if anyone else struggles with racism `` to receive this truth '' said by Martin Luther King Jr. , `` Darkness can not drive out darkness . Only light can do that . Hate can not drive out hate . Only love can do that . '' Treat others better Hayworth was n't alone in asking for the community to pray for those responsible for the vandalism . The Rev. Paul Tessaro , pastor of St. Paul 's Lutheran Church , said the vandalism last week `` is n't Clay Center '' and is the result of `` one or two people who need to be loved . '' He also asked the community to pray for them . `` Maybe we can find them and show them they can be loved -- one way or another that they too are loved and they 're not left out , '' he said . `` Let 's consider that and how we spur one another on to that love and acceptance , to show mercy , care and patience to all . '' Tessaro said among the two great commandments that Jesus gave us is to `` love your brother as yourself . '' `` I think we can do better than that , '' he said . `` St. Paul actually goes a little further and he says ` Consider others better than yourself . Look for ways to serve , look for ways to build up and look for ways to build others up by serving them and loving them and caring for them . '' Legislators proud of response A couple of legislators serving in the Kansas Legislature , Sen. Tom Hawk and Rep. Susan Carlson , commended the community for its response to the vandalism . `` This unity gathering and the responses to the vandalism -LRB- last -RRB- week are exactly the reaction I would expect from the leaders and citizens of Clay Center , '' Sen. Hawk said in a letter read by Michelle Tessaro . `` I have read and heard many comments that define our true hearts . '' Hawk listed some of those comments , some of which were reported in The Dispatch , by KSNT and some through social media . Hawk said he was especially proud of Dolan for organizing a clean-up effort , for Police Chief Bill Robinson and Mayor Jimmy Thatcher for instantly condemning the vandalism . Rep. Carlson said the reason she and her family have lived in Clay Center is because the community has shown it supports and loves one another . She encouraged people to reach out to , talk to , watch out for and love each other . `` God created our skin tones with beautiful varieties but our souls are one color , '' she said , showing those in the community a meme she found online . `` Is that not true ? We come in all shapes , all forms , all sizes , all colors , but we all came from the very same place . And like what has been already stated today , many times , and it was in a song , ` United we stand , divided we fall . ' And another quote from an old Beatles song , ` Ebony and Ivory come together in perfect harmony .

For 23 years , Ernie has been a mainstay at Kroger , bagging groceries , cleaning carts , sweeping the parking lot , and cleaning . And talking up a storm with customers . `` That 's a long time , is n't it ? '' he said with a grin when Knox Pages caught up with him on Tuesday . `` Everybody loves Ernie . He will be missed at Kroger , '' said Cindi Strawser , Ernie 's service and support administrator at Knox County DD . `` I think a lot of people come into Kroger just to see Ernie . He always has a story to tell . '' On Tuesday , the story was about his mother 's chickens . From her position behind the customer service desk , Gayle Palmer has had a front-row seat watching Ernie in action . `` I have worked with him the entire time . He is very much a social butterfly , '' she said . `` Everybody loves him . The kids love him . '' At 77 years old , Ernie is as healthy as a horse , despite his passion for sweets and coffee , especially Starbucks . `` People have brought him lunches and all kinds of food , '' said Palmer . `` We have a morning huddle every day at 9:30 . Ernie comes in and fills his pockets with snacks , and then goes back out and does carts . '' Tuesday , one customer presented Ernie with packages of Reese Cups . Another customer , who 's bantered for years with Ernie about Ernie 's love for chocolate milk , plans to give him some as a retirement present . Even fire department personnel bring Ernie snacks . Even though he 's put in 20-plus hours a week for more than two decades , Ernie has rarely , if ever , missed a day of work . `` In the nine years I have known him , he has n't missed a day , '' said Strawser . `` He 's been a staple here for 23 years . He 's been a pleasure to work with , but it 's time for him to relax , '' said Palmer . As he heads into retirement , however , it does n't look like Ernie plans to slow down . What 's the first thing he 's going to do Monday morning when he does n't have to report to work ? `` Laundry , '' he said matter-of-factly . After that , it 's trimming hedges , taking care of his trees , and mowing his lawn . He will also attend adult day care at New Hope Industries , where he 'll stay active with contract work , volunteering , and probably playing his guitar for seniors . `` I do n't think Ernie knows how not to work , '' said Strawser . `` I am confident he will continue to stay busy . `` He 's very busy with his church , '' she continued . `` He takes great pride in his yard . We know that whatever he does , he will be successful . '' What will Ernie miss the most when he retires ? `` The whole thing . I 've been here 23 years .

We 're going to miss him . We 're going to really miss him . '' Wilson says that in addition to giving out hugs , Nelson often paid out of his own pocket to help customers who could n't afford their groceries . For customer Tammie Belcher , Nelson has made an impact on not only here but her children . `` My son was getting into trouble when he was a teenager and Paul was getting on to him , '' says Belcher . `` He saved my son 's life is the way I look at it . He 's my guardian angel . '' At the surprise party , Belcher along with other patrons agreed that they always look for Nelson when they come to shop . `` It means everything . Every time I come in , I look for Paul , '' says Belcher . `` He 's always got an encouraging word . '' For Nelson , it was overwhelming seeing all the love that his friends and family have for him . `` With all this love that 's been shown to me , I almost ca n't accept it , '' says Nelson . `` I 'm trying not to cry because of the fact that I just did n't realize how many lives I had actually touched . '' Nelson 's love for people is what has made working at Kroger so enjoyable . `` It makes me feel good about myself because the things that I say and do , now I know that it does matter , '' says Nelson . In retirement , Nelson says he is excited to spend more time with his family , work on projects at home , and travel once the pandemic passes .

Multiple sources confirmed to KIRO Radio 's Dori Monson Show Monday night that Chief Best planned to announce her retirement . An internal memo from Best to SPD staff confirming her decision , effective Sept. 2 , was released shortly after those reports surfaced . `` I can honestly say I have no regrets , '' Best said during Tuesday 's press conference . `` There are things I would change , but being a Seattle police officer and the opportunity to be a police chief was the dream of a lifetime . I will continue to do all I can over the next three weeks to set this department up for a smooth transition . I will always love being a SPD officer . To the men and women of the SPD , you will always have my respect . You will always be in my heart . You are without a doubt the best police department in the country . '' This came in the wake of an historic vote on Monday from city council , enacting sweeping cuts to the city 's police department budget . `` My heart is heavy to lose her , and I will freely admit , I wish she was staying , '' Durkan said Tuesday , revealing Best had informed her of over the weekend of her decision to retire . `` Carmen Best was the right person to help reimagining policing in this city , '' she continued . `` Chief Best , her leadership , and many of her officers were truly engaged in deep conversation with community to make better choices for the department and the city , and what resources we needed besides police . '' Durkan named Adrian Diaz as interim chief once Best 's retirement takes effect in September . She also stated that she has `` no plans to begin a search '' for a new permanent police chief in 2020 , and that she would prefer to wait until reforms to the department take shape long-term . Councilmembers approved amendments in their plan for budget cuts in committee last week . The committee voted to move the bulk of its proposal forward during its 10 a.m. session , before giving its final approval Monday evening by a 7-1 margin . The proposal includes cuts to mounted patrol officers , school resource officers , community outreach , the public affairs unit , Harbor Patrol , SWAT , and more . It also eliminates up to 100 sworn officer positions across various teams via layoffs and attrition -LRB- including 32 patrol officers -RRB- , beginning in November 2020 . Chief Best has been an outspoken critic of the council 's plans to cut SPD 's budget , citing concerns over public safety in a scenario where the department is forced to lose personnel . She has served as SPD 's police chief since 2018 , after moving through the ranks as an officer , sergeant , lieutenant , captain , and deputy chief . She is the first Black woman to ever serve as Seattle 's chief of police .", "seg_content_paragraph_starts": "0 23 68 186 212 253 312 367 467", "simhash": "ee15416b433d858af1dff13b9e775bcf", "spacy_content_loc": ["Seattle", "Seattle", "Seattle"], "spacy_content_num": ["7", "up to 100", "32"], "spacy_content_org": ["KIRO Radio 's", "Dori Monson Show", "SPD", "city council", "Councilmembers", "Harbor Patrol", "SWAT", "SPD", "SPD"], "spacy_content_otr": [], "spacy_content_per": ["Carmen", "Jenny Durkan", "Durkan", "Carmen", "Durkan", "Adrian Diaz"], "spacy_content_tim": ["Tuesday", "morning", "Monday", "night", "Sept. 2", "Tuesday", "the next three weeks", "Monday", "Tuesday", "the weekend", "September", "2020", "last week", "10 a.m.", "Monday", "evening", "November 2020", "2018"], "spacy_title_loc": ["Seattle"], "spacy_title_num": [], "spacy_title_org": [], "spacy_title_otr": [], "spacy_title_per": ["Carmen"], "spacy_title_tim": [], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"PoliticsGovernment": 0.9796810746192932}, "second_cat": {"PoliticsGovernment_Municipal": 0.9796810746192932}}, "title_c_count": 10, "tpc_m": {"t835": 0.14465799927711487, "t196": 0.3215915560722351}, "url": "https://mynorthwest.com/2084077/seattle-police-chief-carmen-best-to-announce-resignation/"}	{"_id": "0PTOQqPp", "c_word": 1229, "channels": ["Police^^Chief", "Deputy^^Mayor", "Chief^^Deputy", "County^^Police", "Chief^^Executive^^Officer"], "countries": "us", "date": "2020-06-29 23:39:32", "domain": "wtvr.com", "epoch": {"$numberLong": "1593473972"}, "geotag": [{"name": "richmond", "score": 0.9955731630325317, "coord": "37.540725,-77.436048", "pid": "richmond,virginia", "type": "city"}, {"name": "charlotte", "score": 0.9419127702713013, "coord": "35.227087,-80.843127", "pid": "charlotte,north_carolina", "type": "city"}], "highlightkeyword_list": [["Levar^^Stoney", 0.9738793088334254], ["Richmond^^Police", 0.8384727537381856], ["Kristen^^Larson", 0.003158518568188267], ["Richmond^^Times-Dispatch", 0.0030853556793307853], ["Gerald^^Smith", 0.0027135325954741494], ["William^^Smith", 0.0023631948622921204], ["Stephanie^^Lynch", 8.042183202890371E-4], ["Jim^^Nolan", 6.775756557330262E-4], ["search", 3.870859379589538E-6], ["Virginia", 1.0007405089240104E-6], ["ACLU", 9.703076023387212E-7]], "kw_title": ["Richmond^^Police^^Chief", "Richmond", "police^^chief", "community^^police^^officer", "deputy^^chief", "interim^^chief", "Community^^leaders", "Richmond^^Times-Dispatch", "Chief^^Gerald^^Smith", "Incoming^^Chief^^Smith", "happy^^Chief^^Smith", "search"], "kws": ["Richmond^^Police^^Chief", "Richmond", "police^^chief", "community^^police^^officer", "deputy^^chief", "interim^^chief", "Community^^leaders", "Mayor", "Deputy", "Mayor^^Stoney", "City^^Council", "Richmond^^Times-Dispatch", "Chief^^Gerald^^Smith", "Incoming^^Chief^^Smith", "William^^Smith", "happy^^Chief^^Smith", "search", "Charlotte^^Mecklenburg^^County", "Charlotte-Mecklenburg", "spokesman"], "ne_content_location": {"North Carolina": 1, "Charlotte-Mecklenburg": 1, "Charlotte Mecklenburg County": 1, "RICHMOND": 1, "Va.": 1, "Virginia": 1, "Richmond": 3}, "ne_content_organization": {"Richmond Police Department": 1, "Executive Officer of Investigative Services": 1, "Mayor 's Office": 1, "Richmond Times-Dispatch": 1, "Richmond United for Law Enforcement": 1, "ACLU": 1, "City Human Resources": 1, "Richmond Police chiefs": 1, "Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department": 1, "City Council": 1, "Facebook": 1, "Richmond Police": 1}, "ne_content_person": {"Levar Stoney": 1, "Claire Guthrie Gastañaga": 1, "Lynch": 4, "Gastañaga": 2, "William Smith": 1, "Jim Nolan": 1, "Nici-O'Connell": 2, "Gerald Smith": 2, "Smith": 9, "Nolan": 2, "Larson": 4, "Stoney": 4, "Stephanie Lynch": 1, "Kristen Larson": 1, "Richmonders": 1, "Gerald -RSB- Smith": 2, "Cheryl Nici-O'Connell": 1, "William ` Jody ' Blackwell": 1}, "ne_title_location": {"Richmond": 1}, "ne_title_organization": {}, "ne_title_person": {}, "paragraph_count": 35.0, "predicate_content": ["announced", "named", "assume", "Maj", "continue", "asked", "`", "said", "Councilperson", "Lynch", "-LRB-", "said", "said", "said", "said", "`", "guess", "explained", "'s", "said", "Gerald", "be", "know", "m", "said", "'s", "found", "criticized", "said", "is", "said", "said", "said", "interviewed", "'s", "'re", "found", "opens", "read", "`", "submitted", "explained", "criticized", "said", "hoped", "had", "stated", "serves", "commands"], "predicate_title": ["question"], "seg_content": "RICHMOND , Va. , -- On June 16 , Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney announced the resignation of the city 's police chief and called for a nationwide search for his replacement . Stoney named that replacement about 11 days later . Gerald Smith , the Deputy Police Chief of Charlotte Mecklenburg County in North Carolina , will assume the role of Richmond Police Chief on July 1 . Maj. William ` Jody ' Blackwell , who stepped down from the position on Friday , will continue to serve as interim chief until then . Former Chief William Smith was asked to resign following weeks of unrest in the city . `` Chief -LSB- Gerald -RSB- Smith is ready to lead this department during these challenging times , '' Stoney said during a Saturday afternoon press conference . City Councilperson Stephanie Lynch -LRB- 5th-District -RRB- said she found out about the incoming chief 's hire from the news . `` I believe that the Mayor must have been under a sense of urgency to find a better leader , to find someone that was able to step into that role , full time , and really get things started off on the right foot , '' Lynch said . City Council was invited to meet with new chief before Saturday afternoon 's press conference , Lynch and 4th District Councilperson Kristen Larson said . Larson said she was told about the invitation about an hour before the start of the meeting and did not attend . `` I guess there was some confusion with the resignation and the timing of the new hire . I did n't know any of this was in the works , '' Larson explained . `` It 's impossible to be a part of it or contribute when you 're constantly getting notified at the last minute . '' Lynch and Larson said the newly hired chief has reached out to them personally . `` Chief -LSB- Gerald -RSB- Smith may be a good fit , but , I do n't know . I 'm hopeful him coming in here will help with the unrest and there will be outreach and meaningful connections and dialogue with the community , '' Larson said . `` In the 4th district , there 's a pretty strong interface with the community and at community meetings . I have found the police department to be very receptive . '' A growing number of officials and health professionals have criticized the Richmond Police Department 's use of force and tear gas while dealing with protesters . Incoming Chief Smith said that tear gas could be useful to control crowds if `` they 're used properly . '' `` The sense that I get is that from new Chief Smith is that he is really going to focus on that key leadership and mentorship . He 's not going to settle for complacency -- at least that 's what he is telling us , '' Lynch said . A city spokesman said Mayor Stoney 's hire was expedited because of the `` ongoing unrest in the city . '' `` In an ideal world , the Mayor would have liked to have extended and expanded the hiring process over a longer period of time , but given the ongoing unrest in the city , the Mayor thought it was important to bring in a proven leader , sooner rather than later , who could guide the department through the reforms we know are needed today and work alongside the community in reimagining public safety into the future , '' said Jim Nolan , spokesman for the Mayor 's Office . Stoney interviewed multiple candidates and sought input from other mayors and former Richmond Police chiefs . `` It 's clear that the community wants a reform-minded Chief , and he found that in Chief Gerald Smith , '' Nolan said in a statement . `` We 're very happy Chief Smith will be on the job July 1 , and the Mayor believes he is the right leader at the right time for RPD and the City of Richmond . '' On Sunday , readers of the Richmond Times-Dispatch found a `` vacancy announcement '' for the job of Richmond police chief . `` Recruitment opens Sunday , June 28 , 2020 . Application review will begin July 26 , 2020 , '' the ad read . `` The ad was submitted by City Human Resources department on Thursday . Chief Smith was hired Friday afternoon and the city did n't get the chance to pull the ad before it was published by the newspaper on Sunday , '' Nolan explained . Claire Guthrie Gastañaga , the executive director for the ACLU of Virginia , criticized the `` quick '' hiring process . `` To move somebody here from out of state , put them in a permanent position , in a circumstance in which you 've told the community they 're going to be engaged and then you 've turned around and done it without them sets that person up for failure , '' Gastañaga said . She hoped the nationwide search would have allowed for a diverse and representative pool of candidates , in addition to community input . `` Anytime you 've had a police department that 's had three leaders in 10 days you know you have a problem , '' Gastañaga stated . Smith currently serves as the Executive Officer of Investigative Services in Charlotte-Mecklenburg . In that position , he commands criminal investigations including domestic violence , crimes against children , sexual assault , and homicide . He has been with the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department since 1991 , rising in the ranks from community police officer to deputy chief . Cheryl Nici-O'Connell runs the police advocacy group Richmond United for Law Enforcement . She said some citizens have called for a more harsher response to the protesters . `` Nobody at all has an issue with the right to lawfully assemble and have their voices heard . However , thousands of people invade our streets , block our traffic and infringe on our rights , '' Nici-O'Connell said . The former police officer questioned why the community did n't weigh in on a new police leader . `` When you bring a totally new person from the outside that appears to be hand selected , how is that going to be beneficial ? They may have the best credentials in the world , but you do n't have that community and departmental relationship , '' Nici-O'Connell said . She hoped the new leader can connect with officers . Incoming Chief Smith said he wants to help heal and strengthen the relationship between Richmonders and the police department . `` We 're looking at the community being deeply involved in this police department , '' Smith said . `` We 're looking to actually be involved in the community . '' `` Welcome Chief Smith . You do have plenty of people who support the police , '' one viewer wrote on Facebook . Another wrote , `` he 's taking on a hard job . '' The newly hired Smith said he planned to `` listen '' when he assumed the role on Wednesday .", "seg_content_paragraph_starts": "0 41 68 110 137 158 208 255 313 328 409 456 506 527 618 634 699 721 745 790 811 866 889 916 951 974 1002 1043 1061 1112 1122 1142 1174 1197 1210", "simhash": "d71f91ee87a90339cec2d17b8a076d4c", "spacy_content_loc": ["RICHMOND", "Va.", "Richmond", "Charlotte Mecklenburg County", "North Carolina", "Richmond", "the City of Richmond", "Richmond", "Virginia", "Charlotte", "Mecklenburg"], "spacy_content_num": ["5th", "4th", "three"], "spacy_content_org": ["City Council", "the Richmond Police Department 's", "the Mayor 's Office", "Richmond Police", "RPD", "the Richmond Times-Dispatch", "City Human Resources", "ACLU", "Investigative Services"], "spacy_content_otr": ["` In the 4th district"], "spacy_content_per": ["Levar Stoney", "Gerald Smith", "William ` Jody ' Blackwell", "William Smith", "Gerald -RSB- Smith", "Stoney", "City Councilperson", "Lynch", "Lynch", "Councilperson Kristen Larson", "Larson", "Larson", "Lynch", "Larson", "Larson", "Smith", "Smith", "Lynch", "Stoney", "Jim Nolan", "Stoney", "Chief Gerald Smith", "Nolan", "Smith", "Smith", "Nolan", "Claire Guthrie Gastañaga", "Gastañaga", "Gastañaga", "Smith"], "spacy_content_tim": ["June 16", "about 11 days later", "July 1", "Friday", "weeks", "Saturday", "afternoon", "Saturday", "afternoon", "about an hour", "the last minute", "today", "July 1", "Sunday", "Sunday , June 28 , 2020", "July 26 , 2020", "Thursday", "Friday", "afternoon", "Sunday", "10 days"], "spacy_title_loc": ["Richmond"], "spacy_title_num": [], "spacy_title_org": [], "spacy_title_otr": [], "spacy_title_per": [], "spacy_title_tim": [], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"PoliticsGovernment": 0.993096113204956}, "second_cat": {"PoliticsGovernment_Municipal": 0.993096113204956}}, "title_c_count": 10, "tpc_m": {"t113": 0.23669442534446716, "t325": 0.11247997730970383}, "url": "https://www.wtvr.com/news/local-news/community-leaders-question-quick-search-for-new-richmond-police-chief"}

The Wisconsin Hospital Association reports that as of Aug. 15 there are at least 337 people hospitalized with COVID-19 in the state and 96 of them are in the ICU . So far , 8.1 % of cases result in time in the hospital and 1.5 % of cases result in ICU care . Federally mandated data reporting changes caused the gap you see in late July . Labs processed a total of 11,335 tests in the last day . The state has averaged about 10,400 tests per day in the last week . The state can currently handle a capacity of 23,898 tests daily spread across 83 labs . An additional 24 labs are being on-boarded . Because of fluctuations in incoming test results , it 's really not valuable to pay close attention to daily percent positive results other than to catch anomalies of high or low testing rates . Instead , let 's look at seven - -LRB- orange dotted -RRB- and 14-day -LRB- gray dashed -RRB- averages . Anyone who wants a test should be able to get one , either from their primary care physician or one of a number of community testing sites . If you are exhibiting any of these symptoms , it is recommended that you get tested . Here are your options : Contact your primary care doctor and ask to be tested . Complete an online health screening assessment , and a licensed health practitioner will contact you . See if a community testing site is available near you . As continues to be the case , the best way to protect yourself from COVID-19 is to limit time in public places where you could be exposed to people outside your household . If you need to be in public , please practice social distancing -LRB- space of more than 6 ft. between you and others -RRB- , wear a mask or face covering when possible and practice good hygiene -LRB- washing hands after any exposure events may have taken place -RRB- .

Carmine 's is famous for its huge , family-style portions of garlic-laden everything -LRB- except dessert -RRB- , ample enough to feed two or three people each , so do n't over-order . There also are choices for those with dairy and egg allergy , wheat and gluten allergy , vegan and vegetarian .

It 's served Wednesday to Sunday , Noon to 5pm , for $ 35 .

Garfunkel 's is at 67 Clinton St. , on the 2nd floor , above The Burgery . This legendary Lower East Side outpost describes itself as `` No-frills deli with theatrically cranky service serving mile-high sandwiches since 1888 ″ They 're right about no-frills , and mile-high pastrami and corned been sandwiches , but I 've always found the service to be fast and friendly , except , maybe if you ask to sit at the `` Harry Met Sally '' table , or lose the punch card you need for payment .

Here 's what Grace Riario , executive director of the 47-library system , had to say about the roles the libraries have played since that time , and what the plans are to reopen . Trustee and budget votes Facilities designated as school district libraries because they serve residents of a single school district will be holding their elections on June 9 -- the same day as the school districts themselves . All voting will be done by mail-in ballots . Some school district libraries -- like Finkelstein Memorial in Spring Valley -- have chosen to stick with last year 's budget and will not put their spending plans up for a vote . Others that operate as special district , municipal or association libraries can opt to put their budgets up for a vote at another time or not hold a vote this year . For instance , Haverstraw Kings Daughter 's Library , which is in a special district , will be holding its vote in September . Of the RCLS members , 40 % are association libraries , 31 % are school district libraries , 15 % are municipal and 14 % are special district . Virtual growthDemand for online materials has grown , driven by the stay-at-home order.Checkouts through Libby -- the free mobile app that allows users to borrow ebooks , digital audiobooks and music -- has gone up about 300 percent , Riario said.There were 1,093 Libby users last year ; there are now 3,025 users in the RCLS system.Requests for library cards , which can be done online , have jumped . For example , the Cornwall Public Library had about 578 users in 2019 ; it now has 808 users . Nanuet Library in 2019 had 353 users ; now there are 529 users.Reopening : Step 1Users will be able to contact staff in all 47 libraries in the RCLS system beginning June 8 , and will be able to view each library 's catalog and see how the reopening process will work at each site.Starting June 22 , libraries will begin allowing users to start placing holds on materials through the RCLS Gateway app and in the library catalogs -LRB- no inter-library loans -RRB- either online or via telephone.Individual libraries will then begin assigning appointments for curbside pickups . The timeline for pickups will differ depending on your local library 's staffing and building configuration.No in-person browsing through the collections will be allowed , and returned materials will be placed into a seven-day `` quarantine '' -LRB- following CDC guidelines -RRB- before going back into circulation.Book deposits are open at some libraries depending on staff.Reopening : Next stepsRiario said RCLS libraries hope to welcome the public into their buildings starting by end of June or the first week of July -- but by appointment only.Some services such as notary and delivery for homebound patrons will resume.The timeline for further resumption of limited hours for the public , browsing of the stacks , in-house programs , and inter-library loans will vary from library to library based on staffing.Each library is in the process of creating a plan to accommodate the public , with many putting up Plexiglass and placing markers on the floor to maintain social distancing.Online programs and services will continue.Layoffs or furloughs?Some libraries in the system have chosen to furlough their part-time employees , but full-timers have remained on the payroll as they have continued to work online , Riario said.Health strategiesAll library staff will follow guidelines that include regular hand-washing , wearing a mask if a distance of 6 feet can not be maintained , frequently disinfecting their work surfaces and staying home if they are sick.Welcome back `` Your library has not changed , '' Riario said . `` The friendly , helpful environment has not gone away . We continue to be that way for people . The library is not made by the building -- it 's made by the people in the building . We 're trying to open those buildings in a safe , smart and step by step way . `` Her message to library users : `` We miss you .

A new shortcut prompts iPhone cameras to automatically start recording along with up to 18 other actions simultaneously . All users have to do is say , `` Siri , I 'm getting pulled over , '' and the phone 's front-facing camera begins recording , pauses music you may be playing , turns down the phone 's brightness , and activates `` do not disturb '' mode . The setting will also send a message saying you 've been pulled over , the video that is recorded , and your location to a predetermined contact . Many iPhone users are activating this shortcut on their devices to record encounters with police officers following the death of George Floyd and other recent incidents that turned violent , which were captured on phone cameras . Apple launched the Shortcuts feature in 2018 , which allows users to write their own scripts for the iPhone . Apple says anyone can edit a shortcut someone else has made to suit their own specific needs , and this `` police '' feature is one example of that . Georgia law allows drivers to record a police encounter , even without the officer 's knowledge . How to install it on your phone : First , download the `` Shortcuts '' app on your iPhone . Then , run another shortcut in the Shortcuts app . If you tap `` Gallery '' on the bottom right corner , you should see other shortcuts you can use . Next , go to settings , and scroll down to `` Shortcuts '' and `` Allow Untrusted Shortcuts . '' Use this link in Safari to download the `` I 'm getting pulled over '' shortcut . Once it opens , scroll down and click `` Add Untrusted Shortcut . '' Finally , choose a contact you would like to send your location and a copy of the video recording to .

The lightning was occurring in areas that did not receive rain therefore we had an uptake in our lightning caused fires . '' Bond also says it is impossible to control wildfires caused by lightning strikes , but with the upcoming 4th of July holiday , we can certainly control human induced wildfires . She says , `` what we need to ask the general public is please do your part . Please be careful with your outdoor activities . We 're coming up on a holiday weekend and there is going to be a lot of outdoor grilling and cooking and fireworks .

Indoor malls were finally open again in seven Bay Area counties as of Monday -- and people with face coverings started flocking to get five new styles of Jordan brand sneakers that had been released over the past six weeks , while stores were closed at the Westfield . `` You have no idea , '' Shoe Palace manager Ian Agbayani said about the surge in business . `` We were n't ready , at all , but we 're excited about anything that gets us remotely closer to being back to normal . '' After weeks of staggered opening and closing , seven Bay Area counties -- Contra Costa , Marin , Napa , San Mateo , Solano , Sonoma and Santa Clara -- reopened indoor malls , hair salons and barbershops with limited capacity , after a change in state coronavirus rules on Friday allowed them to do so . San Francisco has so far opted to stick to outdoor-only operations for salons and barbershops and curbside pickup for malls . In Alameda County , hair and beauty services are limited to outside operations but malls can reopen with 25 % capacity , county officials said . Common areas in shopping centers remain closed in all Bay Area counties , per the state 's orders . Local health officials have emphasized the importance of a phased and measured approach in reopening the economy , considering that the move raises the risk of increased coronavirus infections . `` Yes , we 're seeing fewer cases , but we still have a long way to go . We need to protect these gains and stop transmission , so we can continue to move forward through this new framework , '' said Dr. Matt Willis , Marin County 's public health officer in a statement , responding to the state 's new framework on Friday . Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Friday a new four-tier , color-coded reopening system that measures the spread of the coronavirus . The tiers are purple -LRB- widespread -RRB- , red -LRB- substantial -RRB- , orange -LRB- moderate -RRB- and yellow -LRB- minimal -RRB- and replace the state 's watch list that identified counties with high rates of infections and hospitalizations . Much of the Bay Area is in the purple range , except for San Francisco and Napa counties , which are in the red . Malls in San Francisco are closed for indoor shopping but open for curbside retail ; however , stores that have their own street entrances such as Bloomingdale 's in Westfield Centre on Mission Street are open to shoppers , according to the mall 's website . Westfield 's malls in Santa Clara County -- Valley Fair and Oakridge in San Jose -- leaped at the chance to reopen on Monday at 11 a.m. , after Newsom announced the rule change on Friday . As stores rushed to hang new signage and adapt to sanitation and capacity restrictions , customers started getting the word . The Apple Store at Valley Fair had a two-story queue for expected customers , and the line at the Oakridge Apple Store stretched through the food court and outside the mall by 11:30 a.m. Westfield director of marketing Kate Diefenderfer said 56 % of the stores were able to make the quick changes needed to open , and she expects the number to reach 70 % by the end of the week . Many had a head start , because they did n't have to retrain and rehire staff that had already been operating as part of the mall 's outdoor operations . Citaly Aguilar got the news about the reopening and quickly gathered her grandmother , mother and brother to go shopping at the Shoe Palace . `` This is better than shopping online , '' she said as her brother eyed a display of the five new Jordans . `` It 's nice to be out with my family and to see people again . '' The Shoe Palace had a greeter at the door , informing customers about the need to wear a face covering and stay 6 feet apart . Staff bustled throughout the store to clean displays and stock shelves . Stores throughout the Oakridge mall were in various states of readiness . Just Sports manager Imran Arif calmly sat behind the counter at his team apparel store ; he had already been coming into the shop twice a week to clean . Kevin Jewelers was still scrambling to get the store ready 15 minutes after the mall opened . LensCrafters had a sanitation table out front that doubled as security , prompting people to line up a safe distance outside the store . Lexi Anaya said she went into `` action mode '' as soon as Newsom announced the state 's new plan Friday , and by Monday morning , the senior manager of Planet Beauty had her store pristinely cleaned and arranged to allow for proper distancing . `` I think it 's really beneficial for people to get out and feel like they 're having social contact , even if they 're not close to each other , '' Anaya said . `` Also , it 's more convenient to come in and get what you need with beauty products , which can be difficult to gauge when you 're shopping online . '' Hair salons and barbershops in San Francisco and Alameda County , which can operate only outdoors even as wildfire smoke chokes the Bay Area , are still hurting -- even more so than their counterparts elsewhere . `` The air quality is horrible , said Alicia Orabella , owner of Orabella Hair Studio in Oakland . `` And it 's just not feasible for me to operate outdoors . The ground-floor space is n't enough and most of my clientele is n't for dry cuts , '' she said . Hair coloring -- which makes up the bulk of Orabella 's revenue -- is n't even allowed outdoors . Neither are chemical hair treatments and shampooing . Orabella said it does n't make sense for her to open outdoors , so she 'll wait until indoor hair service operations are allowed in Alameda County again . `` I have two booth renters , which means I 'm not allowing them to open either . All this is adding on and affecting us all at a greater scale , '' she said . Some counties are prohibiting other personal care businesses , such as electrolysis , tattooing , piercing , microblading , permanent makeup and other invasive body art , from reopening . San Mateo 's Hillsdale mall welcomed shoppers to more than 50 stores that were open Monday . Mall management said they plan to keep limited capacity and have screening stations , hand cleaning dispensers and social distancing signage all over the place . `` The health and safety of our guests and our community is our top priority , '' said Larry Ivich , general manager of Hillsdale Shopping Center , in a statement . He added : `` We are looking forward to providing the best experience possible for our shoppers as we come together once again .

'' Masks are mandatory at the mall , while communal seating and food courts are closed for the time being .

Rafael Rodriquez said water came up to his Avondale home located next to Little Fishweir Creek . He said it was about 3 feet . `` There was not much we could do even with pumps and retaining walls , '' said Rodriquez , who told News4Jax he was worried about it damaging his house . Rodriquez 's next-door neighbor , Eduardo Santos , had the same concerns . `` It 's only been the last three or four months that the creek -- even with a little rain brings it over the banks -- and you get all sorts of water , '' Santos said . Both said they have contacted the city to try to get it to clear the creek and got this response : The city will get to it next year . News4Jax has checked with city 's Department of Public Works to find out whether that is the case and was waiting for a response as of Tuesday afternoon . Not far away is another problem near a shopping center off Roosevelt Boulevard . People like Jim Williams have been complaining about major flooding since retention ponds were covered and replaced with pipes . `` Where it used to be easily accessible is either closed off , and when you get -LRB- heavy rains -RRB- , it 's flooded , '' said Williams , who would like for the city to address it . `` I guess they 're still working out kinks . '' News4Jax on Tuesday did see JEA crews out working on lift stations , and there were other crews clearing sewer lines . News4Jax was told they became inundated with water from the rains and caused some backups . Lynn York , who lives in the Lakeshore area , said she had never seen anything like what she saw Monday evening during a summer storm . `` It was like , flash , ` Here I am . ' In a few seconds , my driveway and front yard just flooded . I drove to my daughter 's house around the corner here and literally stalled out my vehicle , '' York said . Nearly 3 inches of rain fell over parts of Jacksonville on Monday night . The flooding issue is something that the Jacksonville City Council is working on . A resiliency committee has been meeting about the flooding problems and is scheduled to meet again on Wednesday . The Federal Emergency Management Agency is also working with the city to buy up flood-prone property .

Janis Rose says she and her husband have lived in their house for almost six years . Monday , she says received a call no home-owner wants to receive . `` The village called me to say the sewage system had failed , '' Rose says . `` That 's what happened , it could n't keep up with it . '' ' Rose says she woke up to about three inches of sewage in her basement . `` For my insurance purposes i needed to know was it flooding or sewage , '' Rose says . `` You could tell in my basement it was definitely sewage . He said the sewer system just could not keep up with this amount of water . '' Next door to Rose , 26-year-old Brandon Grognet woke up with a different kind of damage . `` I woke up about 4:30 or 5:00 a.m. to go to work and there was a tree on my house , '' he says . In response to the county wide flooding , St. Croix County board chair David Peterson declared a state of emergency . `` This is n't the first time this creek or whatever you want to call it has been up over the banks , onto the road , '' Rose says . `` We just never have had it . '' `` There was people floating down the street this morning at 5 o'clock , '' Grognet says It was bad . '' Down the street , mobile homes were shifted off their concrete foundations and small sheds were moved by the surging water . Elsewhere in Baldwin , Bill Bennis ' basement filled up with water after his egress window collapsed . Bennis says his sump pump was unable to keep up with the rising water levels . Now , Grognet and Rose say they will try to get the damage cleaned up and move on . `` It 's not something you plan for , for sure , '' Rose says . `` I 've got to call into some friends of mine to see what we can do about it , '' Grognet says . `` It could have been a lot worse .

It appears that many advocates for the poor and the disenfranchised , candidates for political office , and economic development proponents have been calling out for the need of affordable and workforce housing . It has been this way for years , and still , so little housing has been developed . Why ? What does not accompany the cries are the multitude of reasons why there has been no housing built , other than a handful of units by the local nonprofit affordable housing entities and Habitat for Humanity -- only a trickle , when a waterfall of new housing units is needed . Get all of VTDigger 's daily news . You 'll never miss a story with our daily headlines in your inbox . Many Vermonters just do n't have the savings to buy a house or the income to carry it . Specifically , what does this mean ? In North Bennington , The Shires Housing , Bennington County 's nonprofit housing entity , is developing a 22-unit rental housing project at a cost of approximately $ 325,000 per unit . Assume two scenarios that would be applicable to a private developer : the sale of the unit or the rental of the unit . At $ 325,000 for the two - or three-bedroom unit , the purchaser would have to provide a down payment and closing costs of $ 32,500 and $ 8,000 . To carry a 90 % first mortgage , at today 's low interest rate of 3 % for 30 years , would require an annual payment of $ 14,892 -LRB- before any private mortgage insurance -RRB- , real estate taxes of $ 4,875 , and insurance cost of approximately $ 2,000 -- or an annual housing cost of $ 21,767 . The requirement of many housing lenders is that annual housing costs do not exceed 25 % of the family 's annual income . In this case , the family 's annual income would have to be $ 87,000 . Therefore , if a typical new home costs anywhere near what The Shires ' cost is , the potential homeowner would need $ 40,000 in cash for a down payment and closing costs and an annual family income of $ 87,000 . Either of these amounts is beyond the ability of many Vermonters . The second scenario is if the unit that cost $ 325,000 was being offered for rental and not for sale . The developer , looking for a 10 % return on investment , would require the annual rent to be $ 32,500 , with the tenant paying all taxes , insurance , repairs , and utilities . The monthly rent payment alone would amount to $ 2,700 -- far beyond the reach of many who look to rent rather than own their housing . It should be noted that the Shires ' rent payments will range from $ 550 per month to $ 1,500 because the rental units are subsidized . This is not available to the private developer -- other than HUD 's Section 8 program . VTDigger is underwritten by : If indeed Vermont wants to make a dent in its lack of affordable and workforce housing , it can be accomplished , but changes are needed , and they are : Open up more land with higher density , such as five to 10 units per acre . All local and state approvals and permits are in-hand within six months of the developer presenting plans to the various approval agencies . The land that is made available is not marginal , but has good drainage , water , wastewater , roads , and electric power to the proposed housing site . The developer is not required to pay any municipal impact fees for roads , utilities , fire/rescue , and schools . State laws are to be amended to make it not unreasonable to be able to evict a tenant for nonpayment of rent or being negligent in maintaining the rental unit . The state appoints independent `` masters '' located in each of the state 's 14 counties who would resolve an issue if a community/state building agency is being unreasonable with any requirements placed upon the developer . For years , the state and various groups have been advocating the need for more housing with so little ever getting built . The talking needs to come to an end and address the reasons . Housing developers -LRB- been there in my other life -RRB- have a keen interest in investing in housing projects -- so long as it makes financial sense .

The recent report by the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University cited some factors driving the lack of affordable housing , one of which is rising construction costs . Washington lawmakers could take action to reduce these costs by 11 percent by improving the tax treatment of all residential buildings . The study paints an interesting picture of the rental market . New rental construction is at some of the highest levels in years , but much of that investment is going to upscale multifamily buildings . Construction costs have jumped by nearly 40 percent over the last several years . As a result , the median monthly asking rent for unfurnished units is $ 1,620 , which is nearly 40 percent more than two decades ago . While the numbers and percentage of upscale rental units has grown considerably over recent years , the number of units charging less than $ 1,000 has declined . The folks caught in these trends are not only poorer households , but also middle income working Americans . After years of decline because of the growing economy , the study found that the number of renters burdened by housing costs , which means they pay more than 30 percent of income on rent and utilities , has started to rise again . Not surprisingly , this case is most evident in the larger and more expensive metropolitan areas . What can lawmakers do to provide more affordable housing ? Low income housing tax credits meant to incentivize construction and rehabilitation of affordable rental buildings in poorer areas . However , these tax credits are awarded by state housing agencies through a complex and often difficult to navigate process with restrictions that can limit their assistance . Lawmakers can bring down the construction and maintenance cost of all residential buildings by improving the tax treatment of these structures . Developers must currently depreciate , or write off on their books , all the construction costs of new apartment buildings over the course of almost 28 years . Developers also have to currently depreciate the costs of major upgrades to older buildings over the life of the structures as well . Requiring building owners to write off construction costs over time raises the costs of the investment because a dollar deducted in almost 28 years from now is not worth a dollar deducted today . This all means that fewer potential projects , especially those designed for low income tenants , are able to fully recover the costs . It means developers devote even more of their efforts to build luxury housing complexes with higher margins . To remedy this , the tax code could allow building owners to claim all the costs of constructing apartment buildings in the same year they are built . In most cases , however , that is not practical because there is little income from which to expense those costs . A solution to this problem is to index depreciation schedules by just enough to offset their decline in value over time . This kind of index solution is known as neutral cost recovery . According to the Tax Foundation general equilibrium model , the index of long term capital investments in this way could reduce construction costs by 11 percent , which would make low income apartments more profitable to develop . An increase in the number of such apartments provides low income tenants with greater housing options and , in some cases , more bargaining power to negotiate for better affordable rental prices . The added benefit of neutral cost recovery over subsidy programs such as low income housing tax credits is that it lowers construction costs across the board , not only for those larger developers that have the expertise to comply with all the regulatory restrictions on building construction . This raises competition in the rental market and pushes down prices . Joe Biden proposes to move the tax treatment of residential buildings in the opposite direction . He would make the tax code even less generous by lengthening the write off period for residential buildings . This would likely make affordable housing even less attractive investments . Americans need more affordable housing . One important step lawmakers can take to address this issue is to update the tax code to allow builders and developers to more fully recover their big investments by indexing depreciation schedules through a neutral cost recovery system . Scott Hodge serves as the president of the Tax Foundation in Washington .", "seg_content_paragraph_starts": "0 83 188 268 325 398 474 558 629 689 735 780", "simhash": "35c1342df10e32879b48774153a063dd", "spacy_content_loc": ["Washington", "Washington"], "spacy_content_num": ["one", "11 percent", "nearly 40 percent", "1,620", "nearly 40 percent", "less than $ 1,000", "more than 30 percent", "11 percent", "One"], "spacy_content_org": ["Americans", "the Joint Center for Housing Studies", "Harvard University", "Americans", "the Tax Foundation", "Americans", "the Tax Foundation"], "spacy_content_otr": [], "spacy_content_per": ["Joe Biden", "Scott Hodge"], "spacy_content_tim": ["years", "the last several years", "monthly", "more than two decades ago", "recent years", "years", "almost 28 years", "almost 28 years from now", "today", "the same year"], "spacy_title_loc": [], "spacy_title_num": [], "spacy_title_org": [], "spacy_title_otr": [], "spacy_title_per": [], "spacy_title_tim": [], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"BusinessEconomy": 0.9010681509971619}, "second_cat": {"BusinessEconomy_RealEstate": 0.9010681509971619}, "third_cat": {"BusinessEconomy_RealEstate_Other": 0.9010681509971619}}, "title_c_count": 10, "tpc_m": {"t504": 0.28789833188056946, "t631": 0.10323286056518555, "t192": 0.1310693770647049}, "url": "https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/504968-better-cost-recovery-of-apartments-can-assist-affordable-housing-crisis"}

Unfortunately , with everything going on in our world right now , I 'm left with nothing and do n't have much hope that baseball will be played at a high level in my area any time . I have been able to enjoy watching my nephew play in some Little League games , but it 's hard to fathom that I 'm about to go an entire year without watching my hometown Birmingham Barons . What I 've really been wondering all along is what the Barons staff is going to try and do at Regions Field to bring people to the ballpark and possibly make a little revenue . `` During these times , our staff continues to think about creative ways families , individuals , and groups can have memorable experiences and fun at Regions Field , '' says Birmingham Barons GM and team president Jonathan Nelson . `` Obviously , these are unique and difficult times regarding adjusting to social distancing , the stress of the virus and not having the simple quality of life opportunities we have all enjoyed for years . Knowing the need for folks to get out and have fun in a safe venue , adjusting to all safety precautions , the Barons hope to fill that therapeutic entertainment need and also provide confidence knowing that our safety plan , adhering to all necessary adjustments , has been approved by the Jefferson County Health Department . '' Along those lines , about two weeks before Father 's Day I got an email from the Barons : `` Celebrate Father 's day at Regions Field ! '' That was all I needed to see to be on board . I 've been looking for any excuse to get out to the stadium , and this was the perfect opportunity . Not only that , but the most expensive package gave you the chance to take batting practice on the field . I immediately made the purchase and texted my wife to tell her that my Father 's Day gift was already taken care of . The full list of events for Father 's Day included playing catch on the field , a Barons-branded baseball , food package , a Barons shirt or hat , and a private clubhouse tour . Included in batting practice was the opportunity to pick a walk-up song and photo to show on the video board . For anyone who has dreamed of walking up to the plate a professional park and swinging the bat , this was indeed a dream come true . The day itself was pure joy , as I was able to run out on the field with my one-year-old son and my wife . My son just stood there and took it all in , watching all the dads play catch with their kids . It was something out of a movie to see how many families were out there just playing catch . And then came batting practice , a fulfillment of a life-long dream . I was n't quite able to get one out -- hey , we all know it 's a pitcher 's park -- but I got a few good swings in , and a memory that will last a lifetime . `` We had a tremendous response for our Father 's Day event despite the numerous rain interruptions , '' Nelson says . `` We received so much positive feedback , and ultimately the success of this event was based on reactions by families whether it be playing catch , batting practice , or simply having lunch a Regions Field . '' I can certainly agree with Nelson , as everyone I saw at the ballpark was smiling ear-to-ear -- even through the few rain delays we had . This was a major success for the Barons staff , who came up with a great idea , and everything went according to plan . Again , we may not have Barons baseball this year at Regions Field , but the staff is doing a great job of finding ways to bring people to the ballpark . And there are plans for more throughout the summer . `` Since 2013 , Regions Field has been not only one of Birmingham 's favorite entertainment destinations but has contributed to the overall revitalization of Birmingham , '' Nelson says . `` People take pride that Regions Field is not only an incredible baseball park , but is part of an exciting era of a new Birmingham . `` Despite no Barons games thus far , our goal is to continue to satisfy that entertainment need , which is needed even more during these times , by hosting a variety of men 's league baseball games and movie nights . While the men 's league games will not provide the same caliber of play of Barons baseball , we aim to incorporate a lot of promotions , production , and overall fun into these games . We continue to hold out hope there will be some semblance of a Barons season ; however , we hope to continue to add more events to provide even more fun . '' In addition to the men 's league games , the Barons will also have movie nights and fireworks . I want to give a big thanks to the Barons staff , who created a create Father 's Day for me and my family . I look forward to getting back out to the ballpark soon .", "seg_content_paragraph_starts": "0 47 85 123 158 292 321 333 354 399 434 455 482 528 547 600 661 688 713 755 813 924 943", "simhash": "e658fab16ed8ccadcedec43d8f26dedc", "spacy_content_loc": ["Regions Field", "Regions Field", "Regions Field", "Regions Field", "Regions Field", "Birmingham", "Birmingham", "Regions Field", "Birmingham"], "spacy_content_num": ["one"], "spacy_content_org": ["Major League Baseball", "Little League", "Barons", "Barons", "the Jefferson County Health Department", "Barons", "Barons", "Barons", "Barons", "Barons", "Barons", "Barons", "Barons"], "spacy_content_otr": ["` Celebrate Father 's day"], "spacy_content_per": ["Birmingham Barons", "Birmingham Barons GM", "Jonathan Nelson", "Nelson", "Nelson", "Nelson"], "spacy_content_tim": ["an entire year", "years", "about two weeks", "The day", "one-year-old", "this year", "the summer", "nights"], "spacy_title_loc": [], "spacy_title_num": [], "spacy_title_org": [], "spacy_title_otr": [], "spacy_title_per": [], "spacy_title_tim": [], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"Sports": 1.0}, "second_cat": {"Sports_Baseball": 1.0}, "third_cat": {"Sports_Baseball_MLB": 1.0}}, "title_c_count": 10, "tpc_m": {"t33": 0.1212196946144104, "t502": 0.21193648874759674}, "url": "https://www.si.com/mlb/whitesox/minors/birmingham-barons-white-sox-fathers-day"}

Nancy Bell , spokesperson for the district , cited at least one trip to the beach and social gatherings as elements that led to 35 new cases on Monday , continuing a surge that has produced 73 new cases since Thursday . There had been 24 cases on Saturday and Sunday and 14 on Friday during a time when Virginia has seen statewide increases of a few hundred a day , a much slower trend than what is happening around the nation . This also emerges after a strong spike in cases in the district since May 1 had abated somewhat . Bell said in an email Monday that `` a significant number of these cases are associated with recent domestic travel to the beach in North Carolina and other social gatherings . '' In a follow-up email Bell said that `` the majority of recent cases throughout the WPHD are travel-acquired , although I do not currently have exact numbers per locality . `` Unfortunately , the consequences of spreading the virus to family and friends back home could be devastating . We are working with infected individuals and hope they will isolate for 14 days or 72 hours after symptoms abate , as we are recommending , to keep those around them safe . '' This news also follows an outbreak that has placed the population of the Martinsville Prison Farm in quarantine and another positive test that had required the closing of the Patrick County Circuit Court Clerk 's office since Wednesday . That office reopened on Monday . Many of the new cases recently have been young people , and Monday 's list appears to continue that trend . Franklin County had 18 of the 35 cases and ranged in ages from 15-18 to 20s , 30s and 50s . Henry County had 10 new cases , six males and four females ranging from teens to 20s , 30s , 40s , 60s and 80s . Martinsville 's three cases -LRB- two males , one female -RRB- were in their 20s and 60s , and Patrick County had four -LRB- three females , one male -RRB- in their 40s , 60s and 70s . Bell does not announce hospitalizations and did not reveal any new deaths . The trend Monday 's report followed this list of 24 cases announced Sunday : Henry County : seven total , two males , including one 2 to 6 , and another in his 50s , and five females , including one teen , one in her 20s , two in their 30s and one in her 40s . Martinsville : four total , one in her one each in their 20s , 30s and 50s and a male in his 60s . Patrick County : one , a male in his 30s . Franklin County : 12 total , eight males and four females . Three of them were in their teens and one in his 20s . The Virginia Department of Health on Monday morning reported there are 62,189 cases -LRB- up only 453 from Sunday -RRB- , there and have been 1,740 deaths -LRB- up eight since Sunday -RRB- . Some 6,164 people have been hospitalized -LRB- an increase of 18 -RRB- . Henry County 's number of positive cases increased to 250 , with 22 hospitalized and four deaths . Martinsville has 74 cases , nine hospitalized and one death . Patrick County has 42 cases , and two have been hospitalized , and two died . Franklin County 's total is at 72 , with five hospitalized and one death . Monday 's report would not be reflected in those totals . Patrick County office reopens On Monday morning Patrick County Circuit Court Clerk Sherri Hazlewood announced her office was reopening after having been closed when an employee tested positive last week . Another employee was symptomatic and test results are pending . The office was closed mid-morning on Wednesday , immediately after the potential exposure was revealed , and Judge Marcus A. Brinks ordered closure through the week , a release said . The Patrick County Department of Health has deemed the office to be a critical governmental function , and the reopening will adhere to requirements established by the state . The release specified that anyone who wants to visit the office will be required to wear a face covering , have a temperature check , sanitize of hands and complete a health assessment form . Social distancing will be practiced . No more than five members of the public will be admitted to the office at one time . Court will continue to remain in session as scheduled with no admittance permitted beyond court personnel , attorneys , their clients and subpoenaed witnesses subject to the same requirements . `` We appreciate your patience and understanding as we make diligent and determined efforts to continue to serve you to the best of our ability while being temporarily short-staffed and placing a focused emphasis on both public and employee safety , '' Hazlewood said in the release . `` Every attempt is being made to reschedule estate and probate matters , and we urge you to contact the office if you have a scheduled appointment in the coming two weeks and have not already been contacted .

Elise Stefanik participated in a White House briefing Monday in the wake of published reports alleging that Russia offered bounties to Afghan militants to kill U.S. troops . Stefanik , R-Schuylerville , was one of just a small number of Republicans updated on the intelligence Monday , although Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer of New York and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif. , had requested briefings for the full House and Senate . After the White House meeting , Stefanik , who declined a request for an interview , said in a written statement : `` As the representative and chief advocate in Congress for Fort Drum and the soldiers in the 10th Mountain Division , the most deployed unit in the Army , I will continue to work with the administration to ensure that our number one priority is force protection and protecting our national security -- especially our brave men and women in uniform . '' She added that she expects `` additional briefings '' on this topic . U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand has called for a congressional investigation into the allegations about Russia , first revealed by the New York Times , in a story that reported President Donald Trump was briefed on the matter and senior White House and intelligence officials knew about the bounty offers since at least March but took no action . White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany on Monday said Trump and Vice President Mike Pence were never briefed on the intelligence information because `` there is no consensus within the intelligence community on these allegations . '' She said the veracity of the reports are being vetted and Trump was not briefed on unverified information . Trump tweeted Saturday that he was not briefed on the information and suggested it was `` Fake News . '' `` We need to know whether or not President Trump was told this information , and if so , when , '' said Schumer said Monday . Schumer was not invited to an intelligence briefing , an aide confirmed . The Times and the Washington Post reported that Russia 's actions may have resulted in the deaths of U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan . The reports come under particular scrutiny by Democrats who have accused Trump of being soft on Russia after it was blamed for interfering in the U.S. 2016 election and had invaded Crimea . Stefanik defended Trump 's record on Russia Monday , saying the president had imposed strict sanctions , expelled Russian intelligence officers , closed Russian consulates , and significantly increased US . funding for the European Defense Initiative . Gillibrand , D-N.Y. , sent a letter Sunday to the chairs of the Senate Armed Services and Intelligence committees requesting they launch investigations of the allegations . `` I believe that when we ask our service members and their families to take risks and make sacrifices for the United States , it is with the understanding that we will do anything we can to mitigate those risks and honor those sacrifices , '' Gillibrand said . `` President Trump appears to have utterly failed to uphold his end of the bargain . Through thorough investigation , oversight , and accountability measures , we can still keep ours . '' Sen. Lindsey Graham , R-S.C . , who spent the weekend golfing with Trump , also said Congress should get to the bottom of it . `` I expect the Trump administration to take such allegations seriously and inform Congress immediately as to the reliability of these news reports , '' Graham tweeted .", "seg_content_paragraph_starts": "0 32 79 164 177 235 311 351 445 472 554 580", "simhash": "f78441af191e93050ce4c11dde82f808", "spacy_content_loc": ["WASHINGTON", "U.S.", "Russia", "U.S.", "New York", "D-Calif.", "U.S.", "Russia", "Russia", "U.S.", "Afghanistan", "Russia", "U.S.", "Russia", "US", "N.Y.", "the United States"], "spacy_content_num": ["one", "10th", "one", "first"], "spacy_content_org": ["White House", "Afghan", "Republicans", "Senate", "House", "House", "Senate", "White House", "Congress", "Mountain Division", "Army", "the New York Times", "White House", "White House", "Trump", "Trump", "Trump", "Times", "the Washington Post", "Democrats", "Trump", "Trump", "Russian", "Russian", "D", "the Senate Armed Services and Intelligence", "Trump", "Congress", "Trump", "Congress"], "spacy_content_otr": ["` Fake News", "Crimea"], "spacy_content_per": ["Elise Stefanik", "Stefanik", "Charles E.

Civility and any semblance of real debate vanish . Innuendo , character assassination , fear-mongering , and half-truths flood the media and even invade what is euphemistically called `` Social Media . '' The face-off between Clinton and Trump in 2016 was particularly nasty . As things unfold , the Trump-Biden row promises to become even nastier . Today 's political rhetoric , though sad , is like two toddlers fighting over a toy compared to some of the donnybrooks of past elections . The election between John Adams and Thomas Jefferson was the first down and dirty fight in presidential history . Although Adams and Jefferson kept themselves above the fray , their henchmen leveled charge after charge at these two men who were once close friends -- and who ended their lives as friends after they were reconciled . In fact , Adams and Jefferson both died on the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence in 1826 . Jefferson served the pen of the movement for American independence , and Adams became the voice . But during the 1800 campaign , nastiness was the order of the day . Jefferson adherents accused Adams of wanting to jettison constitutional republican government in favor of something akin to the British monarchy . A Jefferson supporter , James T. Callender , was jailed under the Sedition Act for his scathing pamphlet titled `` The Prospect Before Us . '' Callender described Adams as a `` hideous hermaphroditical character , which has neither the force and firmness of a man , nor the gentleness and sensibility of a woman . '' Supporters of Adams accused Jefferson of being an atheist . One Massachusetts newspaper contended that if Jefferson rose to the presidency `` our churches will be prostrated , and some infamous prostitute , under the title of the Goddess of Reason , will preside in the Sanctuaries now devoted to the worship of the Most High . '' In 1824 , the race for U.S. President again ended up in the U.S. House of Representatives . The son of John Adams , John Q. Adams , faced off against Andrew Jackson . John Q. struck what Jackson termed the `` corrupt bargain '' by gaining support for his election from Henry Clay , Speaker of the House . The election of John Q. Adams set up the acrimonious 1828 rematch between John Q. and Jackson . In 1828 both sides crossed what most of us would consider the lines of decorum . Jackson 's supporters accused John Q. of being a `` pimp . '' John Q. supposedly arranged a female consort for the Russian Czar during his time as Minister to Russia . Jackson supporters also contended that John Q. and his wife were `` polygamists '' because they married before her divorce was finalized . The attacks on Rachel , John Q. 's wife , did not let up until she died of heart failure on Dec. 22 , 1828 . John Q. partisans alleged that Jackson 's mother was a prostitute that British sailors had brought over to serve the sexual appetites of the British Navy . They accused Jackson of being a murderer , a traitor , and mentally unstable . The rough-hewn Jackson was also ridiculed for lack of education . In 1884 , Grover Cleveland , who was born out of wedlock , was accused of fathering at least one child outside the bonds of marriage . During the campaign Cleveland faced the slogan , `` Ma ! Ma ! Where 's my Pa ? '' After his narrow win , Cleveland 's supporters answered the question : `` Gone to Washington ! Ha ! Ha ! Ha ! '' I would like to live through one election in which candidates focused on their credentials and spent their time setting forth their vision for a better tomorrow . I would like to see genuine debates focused on issues -- instead of the `` Gotcha ! '' and one-up man-ship common today . What voters endure is something more like Reality TV than political discourse . The end result makes us wonder how such scoundrels could ever ascend to high political office . If what candidates and their minions say about the other side is true , then neither candidate deserves anyone 's vote . What do the current electioneering practices say about candidates and their supporters ? Even worse : What do these practices say about the political appetites of voters ? Looking back through history , I guess political nuts do not fall far from the poison tree . Mike Parker is a columnist for The Free Press .

There are a lot of young white kids marching with Blacks . That tells me these protests are going to be with us awhile . What youngsters lack in perspective , they make up for in passion . ... Protesters seem intent on erasing any vestiges of Southern history . That includes tearing down statues and changing the names of anything associated with the past . But how do they propose to handle the issue of the 14 counties in Georgia named for Confederate soldiers and politicians ? And what about the Democratic Party ? If protesters are going to tarnish the image of famed journalist Henry W. Grady , why give a pass to the party of Gene Talmadge and Marvin Griffin and Roy Harris ? -LRB- Look them up , kiddies . -RRB- ... I must admit I look on the Confederate statue issue with some ambivalence . In all my years of dealing with special interest groups , the meanest and surliest was the old Georgia state flag crowd for whom the War Between the States still rages . The flag that featured the Confederate battle standard was adopted in 1956 in defiance to the beginnings of the civil rights struggles . During the planning for the 1996 Centennial Olympic Games , flaggers demanded the flag be flown at the state-owned venues , despite Olympic rules saying only the flag of the host country and the Olympic flag could be flown . That was n't good enough for them , and we endured all kinds of nasty threats corporately and me personally . When Gov. Roy Barnes changed the flag in 2001 and lost re-election to Sonny Perdue , the flaggers took credit , only to have Perdue change it anyway . I have no sympathy for that bunch . They lost my good will years ago . ... I 'm still trying to figure out why a bunch of protesters in Madison , Wis. , tore down a statue of Col. Christian Heg , an anti-slavery activist who fought for the Union and died during the Civil War . The nearly 100-year-old sculpture was decapitated and thrown into a nearby lake . I am guessing it snows so much in Wisconsin that it produces brain freeze or maybe there is nothing else to do there but milk cows . ... Six members of the Chicago City Council have called for the defunding of the police department and putting the money toward `` public programs that will support working-class and poor Chicagoans . '' Then on Memorial Day weekend , 18 people were killed in a 24-hour period , making that 245 murders since the first of the year in Chicago . The Chicago Sun-Times reports most homicide victims in Chicago are young black men and that the suspects are , too . No comment from Black Lives Matter . ... I saw a young white female flouncing around the governor 's mansion with a `` Defund the Police '' sign . I wonder how she would feel if she got dragged into an alley on the mean streets of Atlanta . Who would she call ? Her mommy ? ... Speaking of Malfunction Junction , aka , the City Too Busy to Hate , and home to a demoralized police force , records show that arrests over a recent two-week period in Atlanta were down 72 % from the same period last year . Narcotics arrests were down 95 % , while shooting incidents tripled and the number of shooting victims almost quadrupled . Serious domestic crimes rose by 57 % . The sad thing is the areas most impacted by these crimes are the poor neighborhoods . Let 's ask them how they feel about defunding the police . Or maybe the armed thugs guarding the burned-out Wendy 's restaurant in southeast Atlanta will deign to help out . ... Finally , the University of Georgia Redcoat Band has announced it will no longer play `` Tara 's Theme '' from `` Gone with the Wind '' at football games . No problem here . I never liked the movie anyway . Instead , they will play `` Georgia on my Mind , '' the greatest song in the history of mankind and made famous by Ray Charles Robinson , of Albany , Ga. . Warning to all you do-gooders , the ACLU , eager-beaver kids and Colick Kaperdoodle admirers : Do n't even think about messing with `` Georgia on my Mind .

John P. Pradun , 62 , of Wilmette , was charged last month with two counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse , indecent solicitation of a child , grooming , harmful material , possession of child pornography , including images involving children under the age of 10 , and possession of a controlled substance , authorities said . According to court records , prosecutors allege the female victims , ages 15 and 14 , went to Pradun 's Wilmette home frequently for parties , in which alcohol and drugs were made available to minors . Pradun appeared at the Rolling Meadows courthouse Friday for an emergency bond hearing after prosecutors asked that he be taken into custody . They allege he recently violated the conditions of his bond by allowing a teenage resident of his home to invite a 15-year-old friend into the house . `` There is absolutely no confusion , and -LRB- Pradun -RRB- knows what he can and ca n't do , '' Cook County Asst. State 's Attorney Heather Kent said via Zoom during Friday 's hearing . -LSB- Most read -RSB- Kenosha chief defends cops ' action in letting Kyle Rittenhouse leave scene of deadly shooting ; handcuffs taken off Jacob Blake '' The Wilmette Police Department contacted Kent this week after receiving a report that a 15-year-old girl was visiting Pradun 's family member at their Millbrook Lane home on the evening of Aug. 24 , which was in violation of a condition of his bond that prohibits him from having contact with minors . Kent said according to a Wilmette police report , while Pradun did not interact with the 15-year-old girl , he saw her enter and leave the home . `` He is making a mockery of the court , and thinks the rules do not apply to him , saying kids were not in his house , when he let them in his home , '' Kent said . The prosecutor also reiterated the graphic details of the Wilmette police investigation that led to the charges against Pradun . Prosecutors allege Pradun groomed girls by frequently hosting underage drinking parties at his North Shore home , and supplying the teens with alcohol and drugs . But Pradun 's attorney Kevin Bolger said his client was in his bedroom at the time of the recent visit and `` did not know a 15-year-old had entered the premises . '' -LSB- Most read -RSB- Chicago 's Tamale Guy , Claudio Velez , hospitalized with COVID-19 and placed on ventilator '' `` He 's on electronic monitoring with a GPS , and he will not have a problem like that again , '' Bolger said . `` He does not think his prior position gives him any special privileges , and respects the court and its system . '' Judge Steven Goebel said although both he and Pradun were assigned to the Skokie courthouse during portions of their careers , he did not recognize the retired sheriff 's office sergeant . Goebel said while the allegations are very serious , it does appear the girl was invited to the home by the teenage resident . `` He needs to make sure no other minors are present at his house , '' Goebel said . `` I agree , it could be a possibly dangerous situation , but he did not have contact with the minor . '' Wilmette police began investigating Pradun in July after receiving a report of a possible sexual abuse involving a minor , Deputy Police Chief Patrick Collins said . -LSB- Most read -RSB- Police in Kenosha bash out van window , arrest members of group that serves food at protests '' During the investigation , police obtained evidence that Pradun had allegedly committed sex offenses against two minors in July , including showing a nude digital photograph of himself and supplying the teen girls with alcohol and drugs , police said . Pradun , whose 17-year-old daughter was friends with his alleged victims , was aware of the parties and would offer the girls alcohol , marijuana , cigarettes and Xanax , according to prosecutors . The girls who attended the parties were aware that Pradun was a retired law enforcement officer and were urged to call him by the nickname `` Po-Po , '' according to prosecutors . After one of the parties in July , Pradun was driving a group of minors to a second location to drop them off for the remainder of the night , according to prosecutors . While in the car , Pradun showed the girls an explicit photo of himself on his phone , prosecutors said . After dropping off two of the girls , he pulled his car over , locked the door , and asked the girl he was left alone with if he could trust her , and then proceeded to sexually abuse her , prosecutors said . -LSB- Most read -RSB- Horses are being killed across France in mysterious , ritual-like mutilations '' According to court records , the incident came to the attention of law enforcement when the father of another girl who attended the same high school as the victim overheard his own daughter and her friends discussing the matter . After Wilmette police launched their investigation , another family with a child at the same high school came forward indicating their own 14-year-old daughter had been assaulted by Pradun at his home , prosecutors said . On July 17 , Wilmette police arrested Pradun at his home after detectives executed search warrants and recovered controlled substances -- Xanax and Alprazolam -- and evidence of child pornography on an electronic storage device belonging to Pradun , prosecutors said . Shortly after Pradun 's arrest in mid-July , police received a 911 call around 10:15 p.m. on July 24 from an anonymous caller who reported seeing juveniles entering the defendant 's home through a side door . Officers arriving at Pradun 's home did not see or hear anything suspicious , and it did not appear there was any social gathering taking place , Collins said . -LSB- Most read -RSB- Coronavirus in Illinois updates : 1,880 new known COVID-19 cases and 11 additional fatalities reported as state death toll surpasses 8,000 '' The judge 's decision Friday to not bring Pradun into custody was disheartening to family members of his alleged victims , who said they were hopeful that his bond would have been revoked after police confirmed that a 15-year-old was recently in his home . `` We are obviously so disappointed ... I think the judge is a fair person , and trying his best given the COVID reality we 're living in , but we 're really heartbroken -LRB- Pradun -RRB- was not taken into custody , '' said a relative of one of the girls , who asked not be identified to protect the identity of the family member . `` These are young victims , and the charges are really serious and horrible . '' Pradun retired in November 2019 as a sergeant for the Cook County sheriff 's office , where he had served since June 1993 . He was ordered Friday to surrender to Wilmette police his Firearm Owners Identification card , concealed carry license and any firearms that remain in his home . kcullotta@chicagotribune.com", "seg_content_paragraph_starts": "0 39 97 134 184 221 247 300 328 368 414 447 467 515 547 571 613 640 662 703 737 770 804 869 885 925 961 1003 1040 1070 1096 1141 1224 1275", "simhash": "7a8214e09c172a5d6f0ae8b7a2852ea6", "spacy_content_loc": ["Cook County", "Wilmette", "Wilmette", "Wilmette", "Rolling Meadows", "Kent", "Millbrook Lane", "Wilmette", "Wilmette", "North Shore", "Chicago", "Skokie", "Wilmette", "Kenosha", "France"], "spacy_content_num": ["two", "15", "two", "one", "second", "two"], "spacy_content_org": ["Pradun", "State", "Zoom", "Kenosha", "The Wilmette Police Department", "Pradun", "Kent", "Pradun", "Pradun", "Pradun", "GPS", "Pradun", "Pradun", "Pradun", "Pradun", "Xanax", "Pradun", "Pradun", "Pradun"], "spacy_content_otr": ["` He 's on electronic monitoring"], "spacy_content_per": ["John P.

I felt refreshed and excited to restart my Princeton journey as a potential Economics major . Since I had skirted around sophomore fall , I had not witnessed the recruiting scene that had happened for my upperclass Econ friends . At first , I did n't even know what IB and consulting meant , since I grew up in a family of engineers . But the response I got when people asked me about my intended major was , `` Oh , so you 're a snake now , '' and `` Selling your soul , huh ? '' As if selecting a major from a drop-down menu online could somehow transform me into a beast with no heart . I was honestly hurt by those words . I did n't want a life of chasing money . I did n't even want to be rich . I just liked learning , and so far , I did n't hate my Econ classes . I actually quite liked Professor Bogan 's macroeconomics class , which convinced me to declare Econ in the first place . I had only really thought of being a businesswoman after graduation . Econ just seemed the most directly connected to that . But if Econ was going to make me into something malicious -- like a so-called `` snake '' -- or turn me into a greedy person , I wanted nothing to do with it anymore . So that same year , I switched out of Econ and declared Sociology , despite never taking a class in the department . Sure , I appreciated learning about race and class differences , and I cared about people and society . But Sociology also felt like the moral major in comparison to Econ . It seemed like the right choice . I finished the spring semester feeling vindicated : Take that , all you haters who called me a money-seeking leech ! I did n't look into or even think about consulting or finance jobs that summer . Instead , I felt eager to pursue a major that would make me a better person . Or so I thought . Come the fall of junior year , I found myself switching majors twice more : Sociology became Psychology , which became History of Science . Every major seemed to have a stigma attached to it : the `` easy '' major , the `` poor teacher '' route , the `` dying pre-med . '' I blamed others for putting me in a hard place . Their negative comments about Econ did n't help , and I do wish fewer people saw Econ as a sinful major . Even though I should have cared less about what others thought , it 'd be nicer if other people were n't forcing their own assumptions onto me and judging me for not knowing what I wanted yet , for choosing broad majors just because I wanted to keep my options open . But in reality , I was the one who was selling my soul away . I wanted the perfect major -- I thought there had to be one that did n't make me look greedy , lazy , or inadequate . In the end , it was n't about the major itself , but about me . I was changing majors to protect my pride , not to reflect my true interests and passions . I was acting out of fear of looking flawed , not out of love for myself . Now fast forward another gap semester later , I 'm back as an Econ major . Since then , I 've met amazing lifelong friends in this department . I was paired with a fantastic adviser for my junior paper and got to research a topic I was truly interested about : child trafficking in China . But I 've also been discouraged and disappointed by several poorly taught Econ classes . I 've often wondered what it would 've been like had I realized my deep passion for English , Creative Writing , and East Asian Studies earlier -- but maybe , to quote `` Hamilton , '' I will `` never be satisfied . '' Or maybe I can accept that for some people , it takes longer to understand what it is they 're passionate about . Maybe I can still strive to turn my `` jack of all trades '' into a `` master of one . '' College is n't about making the perfect choices . At the end of the day , it is n't even about what you major in , even though that choice always seems like the biggest part of the undergraduate experience . College is a roller coaster ride called `` learning from your mistakes . '' If you 're making mistakes every day , that 's when you know you 're doing it right . The thrill of growing up is that every time we try something , we learn a little more about ourselves . The value is in the experience itself , not merely the products afterward . At the end of the day , a major is just a major . But what you choose to do every day in college -- the challenges you choose to face , and the mistakes and lessons that come from those choices -- that 's what will shape your mind and character the most . Rather than spending your whole life regretting a decision , you can choose to accept all your mistakes and move on . Choices give you options . They are mendable and reversible . You can choose a certain job , but you can always change that choice . The toughest challenge is simply having the courage to choose something . How we choose affects our life .

A recent project that studied kin selection was published in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution . Williamson , who earned bachelor 's degrees in applied biology and software engineering from Rose-Hulman , co-authored a study with Mitchel Daniel , a researcher from Florida State University . The study examined the strategies by which males choose to compete with rivals over access to females . These findings are key to understanding behavioral and social evolution . The study looked at how male Trinidadian guppies , a small tropical fish , fight over females . The researchers ' study revealed that male guppies are willing to help their brother out when it comes to getting the female . In fact , during competition one male will dart in front of another to block the competitor 's access to the female . More precisely , their results show that males avoid blocking their brothers ' access to females , preferring to compete directly with non-relatives . This discovery is significant because it shows that the male guppies ' ability to recognize family members contributes to their decisions when competing for mates , according to the research team . The study supports an evolutionary theory called kin selection , which argues that individuals should help their close relatives to reproduce because they share copies of the same genes . Daniel and Williamson developed a mathematical model and computer simulation which combined `` selfish '' natural selection and kin selection . This model predicts how males should behave to maximize how many copies of their genes get passed on to the next generation , whether through their own offspring or their relatives ' offspring . The researchers found that the behavior of the male guppies in an experiment closely matched the predictions of this model . The researchers also explored the effects of other variables on male decision making . They found that the males take into account the quality of each female and how many competitors are courting her . Male guppies chose whether to compete over a female based on these factors and how related the male is to the competitors courting that female . A male might even compete with his brother if the female is particularly high quality , for example . This research shows that male guppies take into account multiple aspects of their social environment when making mating decisions . Williamson 's teaching interests include programming , algorithms , genetics , and evolution . His research interests include population genetics , genomics , and simulation . He earned his doctorate in evolutionary biology from the University of Toronto in 2017 and after earning his bachelor 's degrees from Rose-Hulman in 2010 .", "seg_content_paragraph_starts": "0 38 97 185 247 323 423", "simhash": "2bd91ea758e914a20cd72c5311fc73b9", "spacy_content_loc": ["Rose-Hulman"], "spacy_content_num": [], "spacy_content_org": ["Nature Ecology & Evolution", "Rose-Hulman", "Florida State University", "Trinidadian", "the University of Toronto"], "spacy_content_otr": [], "spacy_content_per": ["Robert Williamson", "Williamson", "Mitchel Daniel", "Daniel", "Williamson", "Williamson"], "spacy_content_tim": ["2017", "2010"], "spacy_title_loc": [], "spacy_title_num": [], "spacy_title_org": ["Williamson Helps Study Family Ties in Guppies '"], "spacy_title_otr": [], "spacy_title_per": [], "spacy_title_tim": [], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"Science": 0.9999165534973145}}, "title_c_count": 9, "tpc_m": {"t247": 0.1468738317489624, "t3": 0.27713704109191895}, "url": "https://rose-hulman.edu/news/2020/williamson-helps-study-family-ties-in-guppies.html"}

Whether it 's used with a thick sauce for a pasta or Italian dish , baked , stuffed with cheese , or simply roasted , it 's satisfying veggie you can find in most grocery stores year-round and it works for various cuisines . Yet , you can mess up that beautiful eggplant if you 're cooking it incorrectly . Here are a few common mistakes to avoid making when you 're preparing eggplant and what to do instead : You Keep the Skin On Make sure your eggplant 's skin is peeled before cooking it and digging in . `` If it 's a larger vegetable , the skin tends to be thicker and harder to chew . So peeling the skin off and cubing it for roasting or sautéing is the way to go , '' says Maria Covarrubias , in-house chef at Chosen Foods . `` For smaller varieties , like Japanese eggplant , you can slice it on a bias and sauté , roast , or deep fry , '' she adds . Not Spacing Things Out If you are baking or roasting eggplant , give them some wiggle room to cook evenly . You do n't want to crowd the baking sheet or pan . `` When you lay them on the tray to roast , make sure they 're in a single layer and give them enough room to roast properly . Eggplant is about 80-90 % water , so when you put them in the oven they need space to evaporate all that water and caramelize properly , '' says Covarrubias . Give them a toss half-way through the cooking process to make sure they 're cooked evenly , too . Using Excess Oil Eggplant absorbs oil too well , so do n't drench it . `` Eggplants are like sponges , for any ingredient you add to it , it will absorb the heck out of -LSB- it -RSB- , '' Covarrubias says . Balance is key , so not too much or too little . `` Choosing the right amount of oil , salt , and your choice of spices will set you up for success , '' she says . Instead of adding oil to your frying pan , brush eggplant with oil when making eggplant parmesan , grilled eggplant , roll-ups , and similar dishes , says Sofia Norton , RD. . You 'll have a lot more control over how much oil you 're using total . `` If making stir-fries or ratatouille , fry them in a teaspoon or two of sizzling hot oil to create a good sear . Coating them with breadcrumbs also helps prevent this problem , '' says Norton . Skipping the Brining Process Brining add flavor and texture to eggplants . `` Mix spices and salt with water , then soak sliced eggplant in the brine for 30 minutes before cooking . You can also use fresh aromatics and herbs by simmering the brining solution , just make sure it cools to room temperature before you add your eggplant and start the brine timer , '' says Chef Ellie Golemb of Culinarie Kit . This will make it taste amazing and have a sturdier , non-mushy texture . Forgetting to Pre-Salt It Salting and pat-drying eggplants are common steps in many recipes that draw out excess moisture . Eggplants have a spongy texture that absorbs fats and flavors perfectly , but only when slightly dehydrated with the help of a couple of sprinkles of salt , explains Norton . `` Add a pinch of salt to both sides of eggplant slices and let them sit on the counter for up to an hour . You 'll soon notice droplets of water appearing on the eggplant 's surface , '' she says . Choosing the Wrong Eggplant A good meal starts with produce that 's top-notch , and eggplants are no exception . `` Bruised , wrinkly eggplants are well past their peak and result in dry and spongy texture no matter how you prepare it . Some eggplant varieties are also better than others in different meals , '' says Norton . Choose an eggplant that 's heavy for its size , relatively firm , and with little to no imperfections . `` Go for the big , dark varieties seen in most supermarkets when making stuffed eggplant . Otherwise , heirlooms found at farmer 's market are great for most other dishes , '' she says . Adding in Too Many Ingredients It can be tempting to coat and stuff eggplants with lots of tomato sauce , cheese , herbs , and spices . `` But doing this will mask eggplant 's wonderful flavor , '' says Norton . `` Using too much sauce and cheese can also lead to a gooey dish , with the eggplant not holding everything together as well as it should , '' she says . Practice restraint with eggplant dish and use ingredients to complement and enhance the eggplant , not mask it . Undercooking It Depending on variety and size , eggplants take 15 to 25 minutes to fully cook . Undercook them and you 'll be left with a bitter-tasting veggie that has the texture of a cotton ball , says Norton . `` Most recipes can accurately predict how much time it will take for eggplants to fully cook . Go for a 15 minute minimum with thin slices of tender eggplant varieties , '' she says . Otherwise , a cooked eggplant will be slightly browned , reduced in size , aromatic , and the inside will be creamy .", "seg_content_paragraph_starts": "0 52 88 93 185 189 296 299 465 469 554 558 648 652 764 769 857 859", "simhash": "eefba94ec1ea0155e317990f092bea3e", "spacy_content_loc": [], "spacy_content_num": ["half", "two"], "spacy_content_org": ["Italian", "Chosen Foods", "Japanese", "RD", "the Brining Process Brining", "Norton"], "spacy_content_otr": [], "spacy_content_per": ["Maria Covarrubias", "Covarrubias", "Covarrubias", "Sofia Norton", "Norton", "Chef Ellie Golemb", "Culinarie Kit", "Norton", "Norton", "Undercooking It", "Undercook", "Norton"], "spacy_content_tim": ["30 minutes", "up to an hour", "15 to 25 minutes", "15 minute"], "spacy_title_loc": [], "spacy_title_num": ["8"], "spacy_title_org": [], "spacy_title_otr": [], "spacy_title_per": [], "spacy_title_tim": [], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"Lifestyle": 1.0000100135803223}, "second_cat": {"Lifestyle_FoodDrink": 1.0000100135803223}}, "title_c_count": 8, "tpc_m": {"t187": 0.17500966787338257, "t552": 0.26471322774887085}, "url": "https://www.foodandwine.com/syndication/eggplant-cooking-tips"}

At the July 2 city council meeting , Councilman and Mayor Pro-Tem Dave Pacheco requested the governing body consider passing an ordinance prohibiting the sale and use of all fireworks throughout the city . `` My goal is to create a dialogue , '' said Pacheco . The city councilman said he is neither for nor against banning the use of legal fireworks but he has heard concerns related to seniors , pet owners , people with PTSD and numerous other complaints about the use of illegal fireworks . The council has considered banning all fireworks before . A town hall meeting was held a couple of years ago by Pacheco and Councilman Jason Campbell where some community members were in favor of banning all fireworks . Others wanted the sale of `` safe and sane '' fireworks to continue because it is the largest funding mechanism for local nonprofit organizations . Instead of calling on the council to adopt an ordinance , Councilman Wizard has requested the council consider putting a measure on the Nov. 3 ballot allowing the voters to decide the fireworks question . `` Trying to be responsive to the community , like I was during the budget hearings when talking about the police budget , I brought forward the idea of a ballot measure to ban fireworks , '' said Wizard . `` That way , thousands of people get to participate in the decision and not just the five of us on the council . '' At this week 's meeting , the council will also be receiving the 2020 July Fourth Holiday Period Fireworks After Action Report . The Seaside Police Department , and the Fire and Public Works departments came up with an operations plan for illegal fireworks suppression beginning in June and continuing through July . It included an enforcement plan and a public outreach campaign developed with the help of the city manager 's office . The council authorized selling legal `` safe and sane '' fireworks , limiting their use to between 10 a.m. and 10 p.m. through July 6 , while continuing to strictly prohibit illegal fireworks . Illegal fireworks activity has posed a problem for the city for many years and this year in particular with COVID-19 pandemic restrictions closing public spaces , the subsequent cancellation of the city 's fireworks celebration , and the Fourth of July falling on a Saturday , `` it was exceptionally problematic , '' according to the report . The police department again utilized a drone to get video of fireworks violations and issue citations . The city posted fireworks regulations , as well as ways to report illegal firework activity on social media and its website . Electric signboards were also posted throughout the city warning of the $ 2,500 fines for illegal firework possession , drone enforcement and undercover officers . The report said that from June 28 through July 6 , the police department used special enforcement teams , on an overtime basis , to patrol and enforce laws regarding the use of illegal fireworks . Non-sworn department staff answered fireworks-related calls on the hotline phone number as well as the crime tip web page , forwarding the information to on-duty police officers so they could respond . On the Fourth of July , between calls coming into the Monterey County Communications Center , and the Seaside Records Division , Seaside police were dispatched to 218 calls for service . In that time , police made two DUI arrests and issued 10 administrative citations of $ 2,500 each , and confiscated about 30 pounds of fireworks . At about 11:30 p.m. All sworn personnel were required to break from firework-related details to respond to a major injury collision . Compared to last year , the last time the city was able to host its municipal fireworks event , there was about a 50 % increase in calls to the police department for service . The Seaside Fire Department inspected all `` safe and sane '' fireworks booths during the sale period of June 28 to July 5 , finding all sites in compliance . During that period , the department responded to 59 calls for service . The fire department used two volunteer drone pilots from June 26 through July 4 working with police officers to issue citations for illegal fireworks use . On the Fourth of July , the fire department staffed one additional company for 16 hours , responded to 17 calls for service with six of those related to fireworks activity : one dumpster/trash fire , two vegetation fires , two fence fires , and one box of discarded spent fireworks . There were no structure fires in Seaside in the time surrounding the Fourth . The cost of illegal fireworks enforcement to the city of Seaside was $ 17 , 662.85 . The 2019 revenues from the sale of `` safe and sane '' fireworks to the city were $ 15,699.47 . Seaside City Manager Craig Malin said the 2020 revenue totals were not yet available . `` The council could vote to ban fireworks , but there has n't been any interest in debating that , let alone actually voting , before now , '' said Wizard . `` That 's why I made the request to put the question to the voters , since many people in the community despise the noise , while others , as evidenced by the volume of sales , enjoy them . '' Pacheco said he believes its time to look at it seriously but balks at the cost that would go into putting it on the ballot . According to a staff report , if the council chooses to add a ballot measure to the current election , it would cost an estimated $ 2,000 , and the council would have to decide on a Nov. 3 ballot measure before July 28 . If the council adopts an ordinance , it would cost less than $ 300 . Pacheco said it is the council 's job to make hard decisions and that the money to put it on the ballot would be better spent on other city needs especially since the city is looking at budget cuts . `` If we do n't move forward with an ordinance , then I 'll support a ballot measure , '' said Pacheco . City staff is recommending that if the council chooses to prohibit fireworks of all kinds , that they consider establishing a mechanism that would allow the nonprofits to participate at the annual event in a fundraising capacity . And there may be other ways to help those organizations . `` I think the city can find other ways to reduce the impact of the lost revenue , such as sponsoring cultural gatherings -- like El Día de los Muertos or Holi or Tet or Chinese New Year -- with nonprofits tabling and raising funds at those events , '' said Wizard .", "seg_content_paragraph_starts": "0 35 86 120 133 175 238 273 338 361 412 446 504 568 636 717 752 795 636 887 904 924 939 1012 1038 1098 1138 1161 1199 1210", "simhash": "e66d8be41ac9c721956c675362e7d9d9", "spacy_content_loc": ["Seaside", "Seaside"], "spacy_content_num": ["thousands", "five", "2,500", "218", "two", "10", "2,500", "about 30 pounds", "50 %", "59", "two", "one", "17", "six", "one", "two", "two", "one"], "spacy_content_org": ["The Seaside City Council", "city council", "PTSD", "The Seaside Police Department", "the Fire and Public Works", "the Monterey County Communications Center", "the Seaside Records Division", "The Seaside Fire Department"], "spacy_content_otr": ["July Fourth Holiday Period Fireworks After Action Report"], "spacy_content_per": ["Jon Wizard", "Councilman", "Pro-Tem", "Dave Pacheco", "Pacheco", "Pacheco", "Jason Campbell", "Wizard", "Wizard"], "spacy_content_tim": ["Thursday", "many years", "three months", "Fourth of July", "July 2", "a couple of years ago", "Nov. 3", "week", "2020", "June", "July", "between 10 a.m. and 10 p.m.", "July 6", "many years", "this year", "Fourth of July", "Saturday", "June 28", "July 6", "the Fourth of July", "DUI", "about 11:30 p.m.", "last year", "June 28 to July 5", "June 26", "July 4", "the Fourth of July", "16 hours"], "spacy_title_loc": [], "spacy_title_num": [], "spacy_title_org": [], "spacy_title_otr": [], "spacy_title_per": [], "spacy_title_tim": [], "title_c_count": 6, "tpc_m": {"t206": 0.13669070601463318, "t821": 0.11309074610471725, "t619": 0.31529104709625244}, "url": "https://www.montereyherald.com/seaside-to-consider-banning-all-fireworks-by-creating-an-ordinance-or-putting-it-to-voters"}	{"_id": "0PTOeF3C", "c_word": 172, "channels": ["Fireworks", "Fire", "Wyoming"], "countries": "", "date": "2020-06-29 23:52:49", "domain": "oilcity.news", "epoch": {"$numberLong": "1593474769"}, "geotag": [{"name": "casper", "score": 0.9967706203460693, "coord": "42.866632,-106.313081", "pid": "casper,wyoming", "type": "city"}, {"name": "natrona county", "score": 0.9317326545715332, "coord": "42.831384,-106.912251", "pid": "natrona_county,wyoming", "type": "county"}], "highlightkeyword_list": [["Natrona^^County", 0.7061010940892041], ["Casper", 3.456719789959504E-5], ["Wyo.", 3.103961156471951E-6]], "kw_title": ["personal^^fireworks", "Casper^^Fire-EMS", "fireworks", "fireworks^^injuries", "Fire"], "kws": ["personal^^fireworks", "Casper^^Fire-EMS", "fireworks", "fireworks^^injuries", "Fire", "Wyo.", "Natrona^^County", "Wyoming", "Burns", "July", "emergency^^rooms", "community"], "ne_content_location": {"Wyo.": 1, "Wyoming": 1, "Natrona County": 1}, "ne_content_organization": {}, "ne_content_person": {}, "ne_title_location": {}, "ne_title_organization": {}, "ne_title_person": {}, "paragraph_count": 6.0, "predicate_content": ["CASPER", "reminded", "said", "skip", "reminded", "added", "added", "involve", "leave", "risk", "wished"], "predicate_title": ["reminds"], "seg_content": "CASPER , Wyo. -- The Casper Fire-EMS Department reminded people not to set off personal fireworks in a Monday , June 29 statement . `` It 's hot and dry out there , Casper , '' the department said . `` Please , for the safety of you , your loved ones , and our community -- skip the fireworks .

But as capacity increases , time at these types of businesses will be more limited -- both food and drink service must end by 10 p.m. and each place must close by 11 p.m. `` The later people are out , the less likely they are to follow restrictions , '' Beshear said on the subject . -LRB- Watch below : Gov. Beshear discusses new measures for bars , restaurants -RRB- The governor highlighted one of the reasons he 's reopening bars is because with the bars shut down , it gives people and groups opportunities to host indoor parties more frequently . It 's those large gatherings the governor has been trying to avoid . As for how people are expected to behave in bars and restaurants , Beshear said all customers must remain seated unless going to the bathroom or exiting/entering the business . Congregating at the bar will be prohibited . Beshear reminded everyone that the mask mandate is still in effect and that means masks should be worn at tables when eating or drinking is not taking place . Staff must also wear masks . Establishments are expected to keep tables 6 feet apart . Beshear did not specify how long these rules would be in place . Beshear reported 275 new cases Monday , but said an issue with labs will lead to smaller numbers likely through Wednesday . He will continue to update the numbers as necessary . The new bar and restaurant measures were announced the same day the governor issued a recommendation for all schools in Kentucky to delay in-person classes until Sept. 28 .

That 's why it is critical we take this step to limit the spread of the virus in the counties that are seeing the biggest increases . Each of us has the power to limit the spread of this virus . Wear a face covering and keep physically distant outside the home . Do n't gather in groups , and if you are older or have a condition that puts you at higher risk of COVID-19 , protect yourself by staying home . '' `` California is using data and science to guide our response to COVID-19 . We are actively monitoring COVID-19 across the state and working closely with counties where there are increased rates and concerning patterns of transmission . Closing bars in these counties is one of a number of targeted actions counties are implementing across our state to slow the virus ' spread and reduce risk , '' said Dr. Sonia Angell , State Public Health Officer and Director of the California Department of Public Health . `` We all have our part in the fight against community spread of COVID 19 . If you go out then remember , wear a face covering , keep your distance and wash your hands frequently .

Counties which have been on the list for 14 days or more are required to immediately close bars , says the department .

The new poll finds disapproval of Trump 's handling of the outbreak at a new high , 58 % , as the share who say the worst of the pandemic is yet to come has risen to 55 % after dropping through the spring . And as the virus has spread from the nation 's cities throughout its countryside , the number who know someone who 's been diagnosed with the virus has jumped dramatically to 67 % , up from 40 % in early June . And Americans are angry . About 8 in 10 say they are at least somewhat angry about the way things are going in the country today , including an astonishing 51 % who say they are very angry . CNN has asked this question in polling periodically since 2008 , and the previous high for the share who said they were `` very angry '' was 35 % , reached in 2008 and 2016 . A narrow majority of Americans , 52 % , say they are not comfortable returning to their regular routines right now , and in the last two months , this group 's expectations for when they might return to life as it was before the coronavirus have changed dramatically . In June , just 9 % overall said they were n't comfortable now and did n't think they would be this year . Now , that figure stands at 26 % . Two of the most notable markers of resuming regular life -- returning to school and the restart of professional sports -- divide people . Nearly 6 in 10 -LRB- 57 % -RRB- say schools in their area should not be open for in-person instruction this fall , while 39 % say they should be open . Parents are more apt to say schools should open -LRB- 47 % -RRB- , but a narrow majority say they should not -LRB- 52 % -RRB- . This issue is sharply driven by partisanship : 74 % of Republicans say their local schools should be open vs. 12 % of Democrats . Whether pro sports should continue after disruption to some Major League Baseball games due to outbreaks among the players and staff divides the public about evenly : 49 % say they should not be playing games , and 45 % say they should . The partisan divisions that have been the hallmark of public opinion on the coronavirus continue in this new poll . Democrats -LRB- 76 % -RRB- and independents -LRB- 58 % -RRB- are far more likely to say the worst is yet to come in the outbreak than are Republicans -LRB- 26 % -RRB- , and the poll finds a massive 64-point gap between the percentages of Republicans and Democrats who say they are comfortable returning to their regular routines today -LRB- 82 % among Republicans , 18 % among Democrats -RRB- . Democrats are nearly unanimous in saying they are more embarrassed than proud about the American response to the virus -LRB- 93 % embarrassed , 5 % proud -RRB- , while Republicans are mostly proud -LRB- 61 % say so vs. 33 % who are embarrassed -RRB- . And anger in this election lies more among the backers of former Vice President Joe Biden , the Democratic nominee for president , than supporters of Trump . In July 2016 , 54 % of Trump supporters said they were `` very angry '' about the way things were going in the US ; now , 34 % feel that way . Among Biden 's backers , 75 % are very angry , up from 18 % of Hillary Clinton voters who felt that way . The poll finds a decline in the share of Americans who say they would try to get vaccinated against the coronavirus if a vaccine became widely available at a low cost : 56 % say they would try to do so now , while 66 % felt that way in May . The dip comes across several demographic divides but seems to be concentrated among Trump supporters , 51 % of whom said they would seek out a vaccine in May compared with 38 % who say the same now . Most Americans , though , are confident that the ongoing trials to develop a coronavirus vaccine are properly balancing speed and safety as they move forward -LRB- 62 % say they are at least somewhat confident , and 37 % not too or not at all confident -RRB- . That includes rare cross-party agreement : 68 % of Democrats are confident about that , as are 66 % of Republicans . In one positive note for Trump in these findings , his approval rating for handling the economy has ticked up to 51 % . But Americans do n't yet see much improvement in the economic downturn caused by th4e coronavirus . In fact , 43 % now say the economy is continuing to worsen , up from 36 % who felt that way in June . About a quarter -LRB- 25 % -RRB- say the economy is beginning to recover and 31 % think it has stabilized , no longer worsening but also not yet improving . About half say they are facing financial hardship due to the coronavirus , a figure that has held roughly steady since April . The CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS August 12 through 15 among a random national sample of 1,108 adults reached on landlines or cellphones by a live interviewer , including 987 registered voters . Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points .

A full 61 % of Republicans said the country had suffered the worst of the pandemic and 65 % said they were now comfortable eating in a restaurant . According to Vox , this is in sharp contrast to Democrats who said they were still worried about COVID-19 and were uncomfortable going to salons , restaurants , or social gatherings . Only 28 % of Democrats said they would be O.K. eating in a restaurant . Democrats have argued for more caution reopening the country , and leaned to enforcing restrictive measures such as mandating the wearing of face masks , as suggested by presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden . Overall , according to Vox , the survey conducted between June 16-22 and involved 4,708 American adults , found a striking ideological divide between how Republicans and Democrats regarded the COVID-19 threat . Although the poll did indicate Americans of both parties are less worried about the virus than they were in April when only 26 % revealed they felt the crisis was on the wane , experts warn the facts indicate the U.S. has a long way to go before we get over the hump . Cases have skyrocketed in the past few weeks . Last Friday , the U.S. recorded its greatest one-day surge with a whopping 45,498 new cases according to Vox . According to Reuters , Republican leaders are now ardently advocating the wearing of masks as cases surge . `` It 's a situation that did n't have to be , '' said epidemiologist Jaime Slaughter-Acey , of the University of Minnesota . She told Vox , states failed to be `` proactive with respect to mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic and to help normalize culture to adopt practices that would stem the tide of transmission as well as the development of COVID-19 complications .

That 's 47 % of the prison 's population infected in less than a month . Every inmate has been tested , and MDOC officials said they 've instructed all 1,296 inmates to frequently wash their hands and practice social distancing . Inmates who test positive are immediately isolated from the general population , officials said . But one inmate , Graham Crawford , 38 , said he spotted an infected prisoner mingling with the general population . `` There was a guy that knew he was positive , standing in front of the fan in front of a group of six or seven of us waiting for the shower , '' Crawford told The Detroit Free Press . `` He was told he was positive and he was packed up and waiting to move . ... Standing in front of a 30-inch fan with his mask off . '' State officials believe employees brought the virus into the prison because visitors have been banned from entering the facility since mid-March . So far , no deaths have been reported at Muskegon Correctional Facility . The worst-hit prison in the state is Lakeland Correctional Facility in Coldwater , where more than half of the population has tested positive for COVID-19 , and 23 have died from complications of the virus , according to MDOC . Its outbreaks were reported in March and April , when 790 inmates tested positive . In the three months since then , the prison has only reported 25 new cases , according to MDOC . At G. Robert Cotton Correctional Facility in Jackson , 46 % of the roughly 1,700 inmates have tested positive for COVID-19 . Most of those cases were reported in March and April . About 37 % of the more than 1,900 inmates at Gus Harrison Correctional Facility in Adrian have been infected with the coronavirus , a vast majority of whom tested positive in May . In July , Randy Rumbler , a food service employee at the prison , died from COVID-19 . Across the state 's 29 prison facilities , 4,620 inmates have tested positive for COVID-19 since March . That represents 12.3 % of the total prison population . In all , 68 inmates and three staff members have died . In late April , a class-action lawsuit was filed against Michigan for its handling of the coronavirus in prisons . The lawsuit accuses MDOC of violating inmates ' Eighth Amendment rights , which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment . Stay on top of Detroit news and views .

A person can not win every time they bet , but that is not to say you should make your bets based upon luck . There are certain principles that you must learn before you can apply the best strategies to win at the casino . Baccarat requires good mental ability , so smart gambling is required . Many professional gamblers , or those that play at a consistent table all the time , know this , and therefore place bets on people who they feel have the ability to win . This means there is no true `` luck '' when it comes to betting , which makes it a good casino game . But when you are new to the game , you will need to learn how to bet strategically to increase your chances of winning . If you think you are a better player than a certain person , then you may want to go with the better player . Baccarat strategy to win at the casino involves knowing what cards the dealer has in their hand when you place your bet . You also need to know if the dealer has five or more cards , as you need to know this for your own benefit . Sometimes a dealer will be holding more than five cards , which is known as an overhand . When you see one of these types of hands , you need to know whether or not you will have the ability to beat this player , and then place your bet accordingly . This is the best strategy to use , since the odds of beating them are relatively small . However , sometimes a player is holding a weaker hand . For example , if the dealer has four cards in their hand and you have five , but you do not have a full house , then it is still not impossible for you to beat them . In this case , your best bet is to fold and move onto a different table , where you have a better chance of winning . In other situations , however , the dealer has a hand stronger than yours , and this will make the hand for you . If you have the better cards than the dealer , you may want to play conservatively , hoping you have the better hand to start with . You can even have a chance of losing to someone holding stronger hands , since they may be holding weaker ones as well . However , it is often possible to play a hand of weaker cards and still win if you are careful . You can learn a lot about the odds at the casino by observing what the players are doing . When playing , it is important that you bet on every hand that you play , though you may lose some money on your hands . Many people find that they make a lot of good bets , while losing on others , so they keep betting with their money . But they usually pay off and win most of their bets , especially if they play their cards right . The game of baccarat is not easy , though . If you plan to play long enough , you can get to the point where you can make money playing the game without spending much money , but it is usually better to stick to the simple game and play only with a small amount of money . A good strategy to use at the casino is to never leave money on the table . Although it is possible to leave the cards and hope to make some money , you should always know that a bad roll may cost you more than you were willing to lose . This is a game where you can use whatever card you have , but a good strategy to use is to bet carefully and consistently . You can easily improve your chances of winning at the casino by making sure you know what your odds are before you place your bets .", "seg_content_paragraph_starts": "0 67 136 1 251 303 378 429 493 564 622 673", "simhash": "0b2aa148955285b51b7c253705003bf0", "spacy_content_loc": [], "spacy_content_num": ["five", "more than five", "one", "four", "five"], "spacy_content_org": ["Baccarat"], "spacy_content_otr": [], "spacy_content_per": [], "spacy_content_tim": [], "spacy_title_loc": [], "spacy_title_num": [], "spacy_title_org": [], "spacy_title_otr": [], "spacy_title_per": [], "spacy_title_tim": [], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"BusinessEconomy": 0.9879873394966125}, "second_cat": {"BusinessEconomy_PersonalFinance": 0.9879873394966125}, "third_cat": {"BusinessEconomy_PersonalFinance_Gambling": 0.9879873394966125}}, "title_c_count": 7, "tpc_m": {"t89": 0.30542638897895813, "t759": 0.10197272896766663}, "url": "https://www.maconnews.com/baccarat-strategy-to-win-at-the-casino/"}	{"_id": "0PTOgwdV", "c_word": 721, "channels": ["Table^^Games", "Blackjack"], "countries": "us", "date": "2020-06-29 18:13:00", "domain": "atlanticcityweekly.com", "epoch": {"$numberLong": "1593454380"}, "geotag": [], "highlightkeyword_list": [["Michael^^Shackelford", 0.012981926172568839], ["John^^Grochowski", 5.493862728007114E-4], ["Mississippi", 9.712173938897325E-7], ["Facebook", 6.575340144392375E-7], ["Twitter", 5.406259940339145E-7]], "kw_title": ["options^^galore"], "kws": ["Bet^^4x", "options^^galore", "Table^^games", "1x", "blind^^bets", "blackjack", "King-high", "lesser^^cards", "One-roll^^propositions", "roulette", "Jacks", "craps", "dollar", "five-number^^baskets", "6s", "Mississippi^^Stud", "two-point^^cards", "basic^^strategy", "standing", "consecutive^^cards"], "ne_content_location": {"Mississippi": 1}, "ne_content_organization": {"Twitter": 1, "Facebook": 1}, "ne_content_person": {"Jack": 1, "John Grochowski": 1, "Michael Shackelford": 1}, "paragraph_count": 20.0, "predicate_content": ["present", "mean", "avoid", "fall", "tie", "are", "are", "Let", "*", "3x", "make", "make", "bet", "seen", "Make", "bet", "4x", "2x", "ante", "have", "have", "make", "is", "is", "'s", "check", "look", "Consider", "3x", "Bet", "1x", "bet", "qualify", "would", "bet", "*", "Doubling", "seen", "done", "bet", "start", "says", "double", "'s", "'s", "bring", "Double", "Double", "have", "Accept", "maximize", "Look", "Twitter", "-RRB-"], "predicate_title": ["Weighing"], "seg_content": "Table games present players with options galore . That does n't mean players should take them all . Some , you should avoid entirely . One-roll propositions in craps fall into that category . So do tie bets in baccarat and five-number baskets in roulette . The house edges are higher than other bets at the table . Sometimes , the never-evers are a little more subtle . Let 's single out a few options that are better left untaken . ** Betting 3x your ante in Ultimate Texas Hold 'em : Before the deal , you must make equal-sized ante and blind bets . After you see the two cards that are dealt to you face down , you can make a `` play '' bet of four times your ante , three times your ante , or check and wait until you 've seen community cards to decide whether to stay in the hand . If you have n't already bet , you can bet twice your ante after you 've seen three community cards or bet equal to your ante after you 've seen all five . Only after you 've seen all five must you fold if you do n't bet . Make a 4x bet if you have a pair of 3s or better , any Ace-high hand ; King-high with a 5 or higher if unsuited , or with 2 , 3 or 4 in the same suit as the King ; Queen-high with an 8 or higher unsuited or a 6 or 7 suited ; Jack high with a 10 unsuited or an 8 or 9 suited . Never bet 3x your ante . Bet 4x or check and wait for more cards . ** Betting 2x your ante in Mississippi Stud : After you 've seen two cards , you have the option of folding or betting one , two or three times your ante . You have the same option after you 've seen a third card , and again after you 've seen a fourth . Never make the 2x bet . A strong hand is worth a 3x bet . A lesser hand that gives you a reasonable chance at a pay table that starts at a pair of 6s is worth a 1x bet . There 's not room for a full strategy here . For that , check out Michael Shackelford at https://wizardofodds.com/games/mississippi-stud/ . But we can look at the two-card strategy to see how this works . Consider Jacks or higher as two-point cards , 6s through 10s as one point and lesser cards as zero . Bet 3x your ante with any pair . Bet 1x your ante with consecutive cards of the same suit at 6-5 or higher . And bet 1x your ante with at least two points . Jack-3 would qualify . So would 9-6 . You might bet 1x , you might bet 3x , but 2x is never the optimal wager . ** Doubling for less in blackjack . No doubt you 've seen this move . Maybe you 've even done it yourself . You bet $ 10 and you 're dealt 6-5 . A great start , but the dealer has a 10 up . The basic strategy chart says to double down , but you 're not confident against a 10 . So you double down , but only for another $ 5 . That 's understandable , but the more profitable move is to double for the full $ 10 . Whenever basic strategy calls for you to double down , it 's because you have an advantage . With 6-5 against a 10 in a six-deck game , standing will bring an average profit of 11.8 cents per $ 1 wagered . Double for the full amount , and that increases to 17.8 cents per dollar of your original wager . Double for half your original wager , and that drops to 13.4 cents . You have the edge , so take full advantage . Accept that you 're going to lose sometimes , but that with average results , you 'll win more often . Full doubles maximize profits .

The goal , the invitation states , is `` to examine policies , practices and curriculum through the lens of diversity , equity , inclusion and justice . '' The task force was approved at the July 21 School Committee meeting . Hopkinton committee member Lisa Macaruso , who requested that the item be added to the agenda , said the subject of racism is a hot topic in the community , as evidenced by the high attendance at the remote committee meeting . `` Over 120 constituents were on that call , '' she said . `` As far as I know , that is a record number of participation outside of the budget meeting . Also there were a tremendous amount of people of color . '' School Committee Chairman Ryan Callahan said the response by members of the community has been enthusiastic . `` It 'll be really interesting to see how the communities explore opportunities to improve our district within the task force , '' he said . `` I 'm not sure what direction it will take but I 'm looking forward to the dialogue . '' Macaruso , the only person of color on the School Committee , said she was encouraged by the initial support from Chariho Superintendent of Schools Gina Picard , who contacted her to discuss how they could work together . `` She reached out to me to collaborate on the force , '' she said . `` She 's certainly willing to do this with as much input from a BIPOC -LRB- Black , indigenous , people of color -RRB- person on the School Committee , which was just great . '' The composition of the task force , Macaruso said , will be critical to its success . `` This can be the beginning of systemic change in Chariho , but only if we are very cognizant of the composition of this task force , and this task force must represent and be representative of minority people in our community : Black , indigenous , people of color , '' she said . Black businessman and former Richmond Town Council President B. Joseph Reddish chairs the Rhode Island Commission on Prejudice and Bias . Reddish said Macaruso asked him whether he would be interested in serving on the task force , and he had submitted his name for consideration . Asked about racism in the Chariho community , Reddish said he believes it 's less overt and more cultural . `` It 's more , to be honest , heritage and upbringing , how people are brought up and not being taught that everybody is OK and that we should learn about each other , '' he said . `` I 've experienced it more in the community , not necessarily at Chariho , and kids are n't born this way . They learn it . And the only place they learn it is going to be at home . '' The School Committee was unanimous in voting to form the task force ; however , Macaruso described the discussion that preceded the vote as occasionally uncomfortable . `` The conversation was complicated , and at times , there were school committee members who were certainly pushed into some discomfort around the conversation about naming the task force ` anti-racist task force , ''' she said . `` I think that that certainly caused an emotionality all around , but that is healthy , right ? That is the work that is meant to be done , and these are the conversations we are meant to have . They are going to be complicated . They are going to be uncomfortable . `` And those that truly want to create an anti-racist Chariho are those who 'll be willing to sit with that discomfort , but more importantly , listen while they 're feeling uncomfortable , and that is challenging . '' People interested in becoming members of the task force are asked to complete a form , available on the Chariho website , that includes a question about relevant positions they currently hold or have held in the community . It also asks applicants to recount an experience that made them want to join the task force . `` We were able to ask really important next-level questions to really form a task force that is ready to do some reflective and deep anti-racist work , '' Macaruso said . Reddish added , `` We also have to look at this as a total conversation .

The council at their regular meeting Wednesday authorized reopening all city parks for use in accordance with New York Forward phase 3 and phase 4 guidelines . The council emphasized that any organizations wishing to use the parks must comply with the state 's restrictions and guidelines concerning coronavirus social distancing . `` If there is another family there who is n't social distancing , then leave , '' said Mayor Michael R. Smith . `` If you can not stay safe apart , leave . It just has to be that way . '' Smith said restrooms and concession stands would not be open at this point . He said they can be opened when the CDC and state give the OK . `` All we 're doing is following what the experts tell us . '' Youth Bureau Director Sandi Brundage said most places in the state are not opening supervised playgrounds for the summer . `` Knowing that we are not willing to staff them yet , people are going to be out and about on them , '' she said . `` If you 're supposed to be 6 feet away from another family unit , how do we enforce that ? '' Brundage said in phase 3 , some moderate , low-risk activities in the city can resume July 6 , according to the latest state guidelines she received June 18 . However , she said high-risk activities where people can not social distance are still not allowed , including contact sports such as football and lacrosse . `` How can we enforce social distancing ? '' she added . `` Again , it takes one kid to get sick . '' Brundage said any groups that use the parks must wear masks and sanitize , and there is no food or beverage service . She said everybody has to have an opening plan . Some council members expressed concern over the legality of whether the city is liable to someone getting sick if the parks and playgrounds are open and everyone must use them at their own risk . City attorney Eric Weyland reiterated using the `` at your own risk '' warning and said any organized groups would have to go through the city recreation commission 's application process . `` The concern here is not so much the young people contracting the diseases , but the contracting by young people and taking it home or visiting relatives who are in a high-risk category , '' he added . As part of the council 's resolution , any sports groups wishing to use the parks must obtain approval from the city 's recreation commission , provide a statement from the organization to hold the city harmless , name the city additional insured and obtain waivers from parents for youth leagues . `` Football is not our call , '' the mayor said . `` Baseball is approved to start July 6 . '' Representatives of the local youth baseball and football leagues in attendance were told they must follow the state 's guidelines , and it 's not the city 's decision if or when they can hold contests even if they are allowed to hold practices . `` You guys , as the leaders , be careful , '' Smith said . `` Be vigilant . One little league kid gets sick , your league just took a really bad turn for the worse . '' Brundage said the youth bureau is also considering reopening the youth center on July 6 . There would be a maximum occupancy of 25 people , but no outside adults will be allowed in the building . -LRB- Contact managing editor Kellen Quigley at kquigleysp@gmail.com -RRB-", "seg_content_paragraph_starts": "0 30 57 82 125 168 188 237 293 317 350 385 417 456 508 530 575 614 651", "simhash": "ccff4b78d938192e8edc815552e37328", "spacy_content_loc": ["Salamanca", "New York Forward"], "spacy_content_num": ["one", "3", "4", "6 feet", "3", "one", "One", "25"], "spacy_content_org": ["SALAMANCA", "the Common Council", "CDC", "Youth Bureau", "the city recreation commission 's", "council"], "spacy_content_otr": ["Football", "Baseball", "` You guys"], "spacy_content_per": ["Michael R.

And piquing the interest of the show 's fans is the addition of a powerful character straight out of the Garth Ennis/Darick Robertson comic book series : Stormfront -- a formidable supe played by You 're the Worst star Aya Cash . Who exactly is Stormfront and how will contribute to the team while remaining under Vought Industries ' watchful eye ? We spoke with Cash to get further insight into the character , and her description pretty much sums up The Seven 's newest member . `` Stormfront can be a take-no-sh * t , feminist , ballbusting , destroy-the-patriarchy , strong woman , '' Cash tells Inverse , `` At the same time , she 's a complete psychopath with huge other issues . '' A psychopathic superhero ? Homelander -LRB- Antony Starr -RRB- already fits that bill to a tee . Having another maniacal supe on the team will most certainly bring a fair share of drama . But when you take into consideration that Stormfront was a man in the comics , the inclusion of the gender-flipped character in the series raises some interesting new questions . What 's your favorite Marvel movie ? Click here to help Inverse rank all 23 movies in the MCU ! `` We wanted to create Homelander 's worst nightmare . '' Why make Stormfront a woman ? Showrunner Eric Kripke says it has everything to do with The Boys ' steal-y eyed , American flag cape-wearing leader . `` We wanted to create Homelander 's worst nightmare , '' he says , `` and his worst nightmare would be a strong woman who was n't afraid of him who would proceed to steal his spotlight . I think that would hurt him way more than if it were a male character because he is a gaping hole of insecurity . '' The last time Homelander had a strong woman to contend with , he developed a cringe-inducing sexual relationship with her while fulfilling an even more bothersome mommy 's boy role in their dynamic . But since Vought 's former Senior Vice President of Hero Management , Madelyn Stillwell -LRB- Elisabeth Shue -RRB- , is no longer in the picture , there 's definitely room in Homelander 's life for a new commanding female presence to take up that mantle . The question is : will Stormfront remain a threat to Homelander when all is said and done ? With Maeve and Starlight already pressing the blonde monster 's buttons , one can only wonder how Stormfront will stir the pot . The conflict between the supes is just one piece of the puzzle . There 's another aspect to Seven 's newest member that will be a huge influence in the direction of Season 2 : her toxic world-view . `` She has certain hateful ideologies , '' Kripke says . `` And the truth is there 's a lot of hate and negative thoughts these days if you look online , that is packaged in really slick social media attractive ways . It 's not like old dudes with crewcuts in the 1960s newsreels anymore . It 's very real and slick charming people trying to hook in a new generation . We wanted to reflect how insidious that is . '' Aya Cash 's Stormfront has some similarities to the character from the comic , specifically black hair and racism . But her character on The Boys strays from the original subject matter by embracing the power of social media in the show . The comics first hit the shelves in 2006 , which was the year Twitter first launched . It was a simpler time before `` fake news , '' anti-vax Facebook groups , political memes , and a president who governs by Twitter became part of everyday life . What a difference 14 years can make . Needless to say , these timely updates to Stormfront not only strike a chord with the multiple conflicts spinning throughout Season 2 of The Boys , they help to keep the superhero series relevant and relatable during this oddball era we 're currently living in . Stormfront first appears in the series in the form of a video being broadcast live through one of her social channels . Up until this point in the series , each member of The Seven has been carefully produced by the Vought publicity team . As we immediately see , Stormfront ai n't about that . `` She does n't need a publicist , '' Cash says . `` She is the publicity machine because she understands that talking directly to fans is the way to have the most influence over her story and what she wants to get done . '' While Cash remained a bit tight-lipped as to how Stormfront 's racism would influence the other supes , the Boys , and the American public , she gave a few words of wisdom to mull over while we wait for the new episodes to drop : `` How can you be on social media all the time and not be a monster , anyway ? '' The Boys Season 2 will premiere its first three episodes on Friday , September 4 , with a new episode dropping each week on Amazon Prime Video .", "seg_content_paragraph_starts": "0 68 113 153 217 237 248 237 338 418 459 498 581 680 726 782 828 874 894", "simhash": "a7fb7252c916b9a3d409f869de7c76be", "spacy_content_loc": [], "spacy_content_num": ["Seven", "23", "one", "Seven", "first", "one", "Seven", "first", "three"], "spacy_content_org": ["Amazon", "the Garth Ennis", "Stormfront", "supe", "Stormfront", "Vought Industries '", "Stormfront", "Inverse", "Stormfront", "Inverse", "Homelander", "Stormfront", "American", "Homelander", "Homelander", "Vought", "Hero Management", "Stormfront", "Homelander", "Starlight", "Stormfront", "Aya Cash 's", "Stormfront", "Twitter", "Facebook", "Twitter", "Stormfront", "Stormfront", "Vought", "Stormfront", "Stormfront", "American", "Amazon Prime Video"], "spacy_content_otr": ["The Boys Season 2", "Marvel", "`` fake news"], "spacy_content_per": ["Homelander", "Darick Robertson", "Aya Cash", "Homelander", "Antony Starr", "Eric Kripke", "Madelyn Stillwell", "Elisabeth Shue", "Homelander", "Maeve", "Kripke", "crewcuts"], "spacy_content_tim": ["Season 2", "1960s", "2006", "the year", "14 years", "Season 2 of The Boys", "Friday , September 4", "each week"], "spacy_title_loc": [], "spacy_title_num": [], "spacy_title_org": [], "spacy_title_otr": ["` The Boys ' Season 2"], "spacy_title_per": [], "spacy_title_tim": [], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"ArtsEntertainment": 0.9978905916213989}, "second_cat": {"ArtsEntertainment_TV": 0.9978905916213989}, "third_cat": {"ArtsEntertainment_TV_ShowsPrograms": 0.9946692585945129}}, "title_c_count": 13, "tpc_m": {"t936": 0.2841322124004364, "t347": 0.2464127540588379}, "url": "https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/the-boys-season-2-release-date-stormfront"}	{"_id": "0PT0fqK7", "c_word": 516, "channels": ["Clip", "Amazon^^Video", "Captain^^Marvel", "Universe", "Thor"], "countries": "us", "date": "2020-06-29 12:00:13", "domain": "sciencefiction.com", "epoch": {"$numberLong": "1593432013"}, "geotag": [], "highlightkeyword_list": [["Tek^^Knight", 0.086168982328375], ["Patton^^Oswalt", 0.02777336234992617], ["HBO^^Max", 0.011216559588245686], ["Queen^^Maeve", 0.003020347554187649], ["Antony^^Starr", 0.0014396147257948713], ["Stormfront", 7.061755372116526E-6], ["Cash", 2.526314297287124E-6], ["Homelander", 1.4038020217403161E-6], ["Aya", 8.036090724870131E-7], ["CBR", 7.047485280463708E-7]], "kw_title": ["Stormfront", "Aya^^Cash", "Clip", "S2"], "kws": ["Stormfront", "Aya^^Cash", "Clip", "S2", "Video", "Captain^^Marvel", "Amazon^^Prime^^Video", "HBO^^Max", "Thor", "mates", "Iron^^Man", "Queen^^Maeve", "Amazon^^Prime", "DC^^Universe", "CBR", "satire", "Tek^^Knight", "Patton^^Oswalt", "Antony^^Starr", "weather-control^^abilities"], "ne_content_location": {}, "ne_content_organization": {"HBO Max": 1, "Amazon Prime Video": 1, "CBR": 1}, "ne_content_person": {"Thor": 1, "Homelander": 2, "Dominique McElligott": 1, "Antony Starr": 1, "Tek Knight": 1, "Queen Maeve": 1, "Oswalt": 1, "Stormfront": 2, "Patton Oswalt": 1}, "paragraph_count": 11.0, "predicate_content": ["getting", "joins", "-LRB-", "is", "is", "-RRB-", "makes", "Starr", "-LRB-", "McElligott", ".", "Check", "fuck", "posted", "clue", "pic.twitter.com/SppWuhNgiZ", "Boys", "@TheBoysTV", "-RRB-", "June", "teased", "'s", "say", "Homelander", "are", "'s", "teased", "`", "start", "discover", "are", "think", "are", "is", "cast", "are", "Avengers", "-RRB-", "continue", "-LRB-", "are", "-RRB-", "dropping", "releasing", "be", "Source"], "predicate_title": ["S2", "Makes"], "seg_content": "The Seven are getting a new addition in Season 2 of Amazon Prime Video 's hit superhero satire ` The Boys ' . Aya Cash joins the cast as Stormfront , who appears to have weather-control abilities . -LRB- In the comics , the character is male and is a dark mixture of Thor and DC 's Captain Marvel/Shazam . That version is also a Nazi . -RRB- Cash 's Stormfront makes her debut in a new clip from the second season , in which she appears to crash a commercial shoot featuring The Homelander -LRB- Antony Starr -RRB- and Queen Maeve -LRB- Dominique McElligott -RRB- . Check out her introduction below : What the fuck ? The newest member of The Seven just posted this . Any clue what 's going on , mates ? pic.twitter.com/SppWuhNgiZ -- The Boys -LRB- @TheBoysTV -RRB- June 26 , 2020 During a recent reunion special hosted by Patton Oswalt , Cash teased her character , saying : `` Stormfront 's a new member of the Seven and she 's a new villain . And I would say she is on par if not worse than Homelander ... Homelander and Stormfront , I would say , that when they first meet , there are fireworks . Like any meet-cute , there 's a lot of tension and combativeness between them , but I also think that Stormfront ends up earning his respect throughout the season . '' But Cash teased that fans wo n't entirely know what to expect from Stormfront . `` You start off this season thinking she 's one thing and then discover she 's another . There are quite a few times where you 'll identify with her as an audience member or agree with what she says . I think -LSB- those -RSB- are the most dangerous people . '' Stormfront is n't the only new Super showing up in S2 . Oswalt has actually been cast to play Tek Knight , the comic book 's pastiche of Iron Man . In the comics , both Tek Knight and Stormfront are members of a different team called Payback -LRB- The Avengers -RRB- . But perhaps because The Seven were given such a high-profile in Season 1 , the TV adaptation will continue to focus on them and will simply bring other corrupt Supers into their orbit rather than devoting entire episodes or seasons to these other groups and shifting focus away from The Seven . -LRB- In the comics , the Supers are n't as heavily featured as they are on the TV show . -RRB- ` The Boys ' will return on September 4 , however this season , Prime Video is n't dropping the whole shebang at once . Just like in the case of DC Universe and HBO Max 's ` Doom Patrol ' Season 2 which arrived last week , Prime is only releasing three episodes on Sept. 4 , and further new episodes will be released one-per-week on Fridays .

As the pandemic rages on , there 's speculation about how Covid-19 is changing work , with many claims of a massive , permanent shift to working at home . But do n't sell your second car or turn in your commuter rail pass just yet . The jury is still out on the scale of any shift to working at home , and many white-collar workers will probably return to their offices . Some studies suggest a huge Covid-driven shift to home work . Researchers at MIT used a Google survey to conclude `` that since between February and May 2020 over one-third of the labor force switched to remote work , resulting in about half of American workers now working from home . '' About half of American workers ? That 's well above a University of Chicago study estimating an `` upper bound on what might be feasible , '' finding that `` 37 percent of jobs in the United States can be performed entirely at home . '' If the MIT study is right , then many more jobs are actually being done at home than the Chicago researchers found to be possible ! In turn , both of these estimates are very large when compared to more comprehensive and pre-pandemic data sources . The U.S. Census Bureau estimated that in 2018 , only 5.3 % of workers worked from home . -LRB- Other federal sources find somewhat higher numbers but the difference is rooted at least partly in how the question is asked . -RRB- The MIT results may be inflated by their measuring responses at the height of the pandemic , when the economy was virtually shutting down . A better way to think about the issue is identifying which jobs and industries can be done at home , which both teams do . The Chicago study uses twenty-two separate occupational clusters from the Bureau of Labor Statistics ' Standard Occupational Classification -LRB- SOC -RRB- system , allowing a more fine-grained analysis . Not surprisingly , different occupational clusters have different work-at-home potential . These include ten job groups at the bottom range of 6 % or below , including zero jobs in `` construction or extraction '' or `` food service preparation and serving . '' At the high end , there are nine clusters above 50 % , including five higher than 87 % , including `` legal '' -LRB- 97 % -RRB- , `` education , training and library '' -LRB- 98 % -RRB- , and `` computer and mathematical '' -LRB- 100 % -RRB- occupations . Jobs with work-at-home potential also pay higher median wages . And metropolitan areas with more of these jobs are linked to higher household incomes and workers with college degrees , while there 's a negative correlation for metros with homeownership rates and percent of white residents . But just because your job can be done at home does n't mean it will be , especially in the long term . Although U.S. workers are slow to return to their offices , countries where the pandemic is managed better report much higher rates of return . The Guardian reports a survey from Morgan Stanley 's AlphaWise finds `` 83 % of French office staff have returned , followed by 76 % in Italy '' due partly to those countries ' more successful virus management . There are a lot of reasons , both for employers and employees , to work together . First , as noted , many occupations simply ca n't be done from home . And even for those that can , analysts worry about productivity . Stanford economist Nicholas Bloom fears a surge in home-based work `` will create a productivity disaster for firms . '' -LRB- This is a surprising turnaround , since Bloom in 2014 wrote a Harvard Business Review article entitled `` To Raise Productivity , Let More Employees Work From Home . '' -RRB- The difference is pandemic-driven working from home often is n't voluntary or planned well , so it often can be less productive . Especially for families with school-age children , the work environment is n't controllable for noise or disruption . And working exclusively at home -- versus some of the time in a planned strategy -- could reduce innovation , which many analysts feel comes from sustained face-to-face interactions . Face-to-face interactions also build networks , which help people advance in their careers . That 's why women professionals rightly fear being bumped onto the `` mommy track '' if they take child care leave . As economist Heather Boushey has shown , our inadequate public policy for care work means women are pushed into providing care for children , along with the elderly and other dependents . This means their careers suffer along with overall productivity and innovation . So working at home could add a new lane to the `` mommy track . '' Another barrier to working out of the office is management 's need to control work . Marxist economist Harry Braverman , in his famous book Labor and Monopoly Capital , showed how modern managerial methods evolved out of the need to discipline workers for maximum productivity . When I was writing a study of New York 's financial services industry , a senior manager illustrated this point , saying office jobs would n't be relocated too far away because `` you need to be able to go down the hall and yell at somebody . '' It 's clear that lots of employees want to work at home at least some of the time , as Forbes contributor John Koetsier has told us . But it 's less likely that employers will let them do so on a massive scale . Yahoo made a massive turnaround in 2013 , ordering staff back to the office in order to increase productivity . Because of Covid , companies like Google and Facebook have told workers they can work remotely until mid-2021 . But Facebook also recently leased a massive new office location in mid-Manhattan . They 're going to put somebody in there . So whatever Covid-driven spike we are seeing in home working will likely recede . It may become a new perk for highly skilled or highly sought-after workers . But it 's unlikely to become the `` new normal , '' even if many white-collar workers want it . Innovation , productivity , networking , and managerial control all are working against it .", "seg_content_paragraph_starts": "0 24 98 115 150 222 284 363 460 507 563 594 626 690 761 797 857 953 1018 1059", "simhash": "aaea4744795ae62b4e4c06750a767ccb", "spacy_content_loc": ["the United States", "Chicago", "Chicago", "U.S.", "Italy"], "spacy_content_num": ["second", "one-third", "about half", "About half", "37 percent", "only 5.3 %", "twenty-two", "ten", "6 %", "zero", "nine", "above 50 %", "five", "87 %", "97 %", "98 %", "100 %", "` 83 %", "76 %", "First"], "spacy_content_org": ["Covid", "MIT", "Google", "American", "American", "University of Chicago", "MIT", "The U.S. Census Bureau", "MIT", "the Bureau of Labor Statistics '", "Guardian", "Morgan Stanley 's", "AlphaWise", "French", "Stanford", "Harvard Business Review", "Marxist", "Labor and Monopoly Capital"], "spacy_content_otr": ["` To Raise Productivity"], "spacy_content_per": ["Nicholas Bloom", "Heather Boushey", "Harry Braverman"], "spacy_content_tim": ["between February and May 2020", "2018", "2014"], "spacy_title_loc": [], "spacy_title_num": [], "spacy_title_org": [], "spacy_title_otr": [], "spacy_title_per": [], "spacy_title_tim": [], "text_category": {}, "title_c_count": 13, "tpc_m": {"t977": 0.3126569390296936, "t157": 0.2283470630645752, "t707": 0.16113612055778503}, "url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardmcgahey/2020/08/24/is-home-work-your-employment-future-office-work-isnt-dead-yet/"}	{"_id": "0PTOh1su", "c_word": 1367, "channels": ["Economic^^Research", "Social^^Research", "Business^^Research", "Stanford^^Business", "Business^^Economics"], "countries": "us", "date": "2020-06-29 13:00:00", "domain": "stanford.edu", "epoch": {"$numberLong": "1593435600"}, "geotag": [{"name": "stanford", "score": 0.9782067537307739, "coord": "37.424106,-122.166076", "pid": "stanford,california", "type": "city"}], "highlightkeyword_list": [["working-from-home^^economy", 0.9885273534430175], ["Nicholas^^Bloom", 0.9415179457233179], ["Stanford", 6.439172470803237E-6], ["economy", 5.9112817253157215E-6], ["London", 8.765769300669047E-7], ["Tokyo", 7.604696566124599E-7], ["research", 7.232186706831031E-7]], "kw_title": ["working-from-home^^economy", "Economic^^Policy^^Research", "Stanford", "ongoing^^research"], "kws": ["working-from-home^^economy", "Economic^^Policy^^Research", "Stanford", "labor^^economics", "ongoing^^research", "Professor", "U.S.^^economic^^activity", "management^^practices", "economist", "Business^^Uncertainty", "society", "Humanities", "business^^firms", "landscape", "Policy", "financial^^workers", "inequality", "policymakers", "bleak^^prospects", "uncertainty"], "ne_content_location": {"London": 1, "New York": 1, "U.S.": 5, "Tokyo": 1}, "ne_content_organization": {"University of Chicago": 1, "Atlanta Federal Reserve": 1, "Stanford": 2, "William D.

The new `` working-from-home economy , '' which is likely to continue long past the coronavirus pandemic that spawned it , poses new challenges -- from a ticking time bomb for inequality to an erosion of city centers -- according to Stanford economist Nicholas Bloom . Results from several nationwide surveys Bloom has been conducting during the COVID-related economic shutdown provide a snapshot of the emerging new reality . Bloom , who is the William D. Eberle Professor of Economics in Stanford 's School of Humanities and Sciences and a senior fellow at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research -LRB- SIEPR -RRB- , focuses on labor economics , management practices and uncertainty . Since the coronavirus crisis broke out , his 2014 study on working from home and ongoing research with other colleagues on business firms have been in high demand as policymakers and others scramble to better understand the shifting dynamics of the workforce and its economic implications . Here , Bloom discusses the societal impacts of working from home and what his latest research reveals . And in a related SIEPR Policy Brief , he expands on his findings and offers policymakers and business leaders suggestions for making remote-work a permanent part of the labor landscape . We live in an information economy and a gig economy . Now you 've identified a new `` working-from-home economy . '' Why is that ? We see an incredible 42 percent of the U.S. labor force now working from home full-time . About another 33 percent are not working -- a testament to the savage impact of the lockdown recession . And the remaining 26 percent -- mostly essential service workers -- are working on their business premises . So , by sheer numbers , the U.S. is a working-from-home economy . Almost twice as many employees are working from home as at work . More strikingly , if we consider the contribution to U.S. gross domestic product based on their earnings , this enlarged group of work-from-home employees now accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity . How vital was the swift shift to working at home during the COVID crisis ? Without this historic switch to working from home , the lockdown could never have lasted . The economy would have collapsed , forcing us to return to work , reigniting infection rates . Working from home is not only economically essential , it is a critical weapon in our fight against COVID-19 -- and future pandemics . Why do you think working remotely is morphing into a more permanent reality ? The stigma associated with working from home prior to COVID-19 has disappeared . And working remotely is now extremely common , though under very challenging conditions , as I 've written about earlier . And a number of corporations are developing plans for more work-from-home options beyond the pandemic . A recent separate survey of firms from the Survey of Business Uncertainty that I run with the Atlanta Federal Reserve and the University of Chicago indicated that the share of working days spent at home is expected to increase fourfold from pre-COVID levels , from 5 percent to 20 percent . Of the dozens of firms I have talked to , the typical plan is that employees will work from home one to three days a week , and come into the office the rest of the time . What red flags are you seeing ? Not everyone can work from home . Only 51 percent of the survey respondents -- mostly managers , professionals and financial workers who can carry out their jobs on computers -- reported being able to work from home at an efficiency rate of 80 percent or more . The remaining -LRB- nearly -RRB- half can not work remotely . They work in retail , healthcare , transport and business services , and need to see customers or work with products or equipment . Many Americans also lack the facilities or sufficient internet capacity to work effectively from home . More than half of those surveyed who are now working from home are doing so either in shared rooms or their bedrooms . And only 65 percent of Americans reported having fast enough internet capacity to support workable video calls . The remaining 35 percent have such poor internet at home -- or no internet -- that it prevents effective telecommuting . What do all these negatives add up to ? Taken together , this is generating a time bomb for inequality . Our results show that more educated , higher-earning employees are far more likely to work from home -- so they are continuing to get paid , develop their skills and advance their careers . At the same time , those unable to work from home -- either because of the nature of their jobs , or because they lack suitable space or internet connections -- are being left behind . They face bleak prospects if their skills and work experience erode during an extended shutdown and beyond . What other impacts should we watch for in this transition to more remote work ? Growth of city centers are going to stall . During the pandemic , the overwhelming share of employees who shifted to telecommuting previously worked in offices in cities . I estimate that the loss of their physical presence slashed total daily spending at city center restaurants , bars and shops by more than half . This upsurge in working from home is largely here to stay , and I see a longer-run decline in city centers . The largest U.S. cities have seen incredible growth since the 1980s as younger , educated Americans have flocked into revitalized downtowns . But it looks like that trend will reverse in 2020 -- with a flight of economic activity out of city centers . Where will the workforce go ? The upside is this will be a boom for suburbs and rural areas . Given the need for social distancing , the firms I talk to are typically thinking about halving the density of offices , which would lead to an increase in the overall demand for office space . But instead of building more office skyscrapers -- which has been the dominant theme over the past 40 years -- I predict that COVID-19 will dramatically shift the trend to industrial parks with low-rise buildings . High-rises in cities face two massive challenges post-COVID . First , mass-transit -- the subway , trains and buses . How can you get several million workers in and out of major cities like New York , London or Tokyo every day with social distancing ? Second , elevators . Typically , before COVID , you could squeeze people into an elevator , with each person taking roughly four square feet of space . But if we enforce six feet of social distancing we need more like 100 square feet of space , cutting the capacity of elevators by over 90 percent , making it impossible for employees to reach their desks during rush hours . What if social distancing is no longer needed ? Nobody knows for sure , but if a COVID-19 vaccine eventually comes out , my prediction is that society will have become accustomed to social distancing . And given other recent near-miss pandemics like SARS , Ebola , MERS and avian-flu , or the prior influenza pandemics of 1957-58 and 1968 , firms and employees will fear the potential need to return to social distancing . So I anticipate many firms will be reluctant to rapidly return to dense offices . My latest survey results seem to bear this out : employees reported a 25 percent drop in demand to work in high-rise offices in 2021 , presumably after COVID . If I were a company right now planning the future of my office , I would be looking to the suburbs .", "seg_content_paragraph_starts": "0 28 74 97 189 238 264 344 379 394 451 465 499 566 604 611 659 694 772 781 881 896 951 1017 1023 1037 1109 1155 1225 1234 1315 1345", "simhash": "e5006775838966a34c058fbcf6c63064", "spacy_content_loc": ["U.S.", "U.S.", "U.S.", "U.S."], "spacy_content_num": ["42 percent", "About another 33 percent", "26 percent", "more than two-thirds", "5 percent to 20 percent", "dozens", "Only 51 percent", "80 percent", "half", "More than half", "only 65 percent", "35 percent"], "spacy_content_org": ["Stanford", "Stanford", "Bloom", "COVID", "Stanford", "School of Humanities and Sciences", "the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research", "COVID", "the Survey of Business Uncertainty", "the Atlanta Federal Reserve", "the University of Chicago", "pre-COVID", "healthcare", "Americans", "Americans"], "spacy_content_otr": ["SIEPR Policy Brief"], "spacy_content_per": ["Nicholas Bloom", "Nicholas Bloom", "William D.

The state Board of Economic Advisors meets Monday to close the books on the budget year that ended June 30 . The economists on the board will then discuss what factors go into predicting how much revenue South Carolina will collect in taxes and fees for the 2020-2021 budget year that started July 1 . The board will issue an official prediction on Aug. 31 . They have suggested the $ 9.4 billion in the budget for last year wo n't change much . But they have also warned there may be a lot more margin for error in this year 's estimates . The House typically writes the new budget , but they passed their spending plan in March just before the coronavirus pandemic shutdown . House leaders said the economic downturn means they ca n't use that plan .

Just this summer , the High Country Conservation Center has grown just over 500 pounds of produce at part of its grow to share program , valuing around $ 3,168 . The program grows and collects produce at the Dillon Valley Elementary community garden , which it then donates to families enrolled in the county 's Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women , Infants & Children and the food bank at the Family & Intercultural Resource Center . The program started as a way for community gardeners to donate extra produce to the three organizations . `` -LRB- When the program started -RRB- we just wanted to eliminate waste and make sure we were feeding more fresh , locally-grown produce into the hands of our families , '' said Whitney Horner , Summit County 's Women , Infants & Children director . In 2016 , the garden at Dillon Valley became dedicated to teaching the 250 Women , Infants & Children program families about nutrition and healthy living . Although the novel coronavirus pandemic meant the program was unable to offer the same level of hands-on activity as before , the community garden has remained a place for growth and education . Kyla Laplante , the head gardener at the conservation center , has used the opportunity to maximize production . In 2019 , the program generated around 420 pounds of produce over the summer . With a month left in the growing season , the program has far surpassed last year 's numbers . `` It kind of developed initially as a feeding program . We were just taking donations for the garden , '' Laplante said . `` I do n't think we ever thought it would be going into full production mode for the program . '' In the past , the program used the school as an educational space to teach families about nutrition , pass out recipes and give cooking advice . `` We had to kind of shift our model and be adaptive , as has everybody with COVID this year , '' Horner said . `` We really focused more on maximizing production out of Dillon Valley and trying to give as much food out to the families since we 're not doing as many class gatherings . '' During the pandemic , the garden is open to 20 Women , Infants & Children families every Tuesday . Horner said the families are able to sign up and come pick their produce . Anything that 's left over is donated to the food pantry at the resource center . Horner , who is also a dietician , said the program is invaluable to the families involved as it gives them a chance for healthier lifestyle . `` Just getting families excited about trying new foods is a huge benefit , '' she said . `` We 're having families who otherwise might not normally buy kale or some of these vegetables in the store . -LRB- We -RRB- hope that by educating them and giving them exposure to this fresh grown produce , they 'll continue to eat their greens all year round . '' The program also helps with the conservation center 's efforts to help the environment . `` When you think about lettuce and greens that are grown in California , they travel over 1,200 miles to reach Summit County , '' Horner said . `` -LRB- At the community garden -RRB- they 're actually locally grown here so it 's going to count for less emissions and much more nutrition .

Making the call was the first in what could be a couple of painful decisions for the North Texas graduate and longtime UNT football fan . Jackson and his family have purchased UNT season tickets in eight of the last 10 years , each year they 've lived in the Dallas area . Due to his concerns over the pandemic , Jackson still had n't made up his mind about whether he would renew his tickets for lower bowl seats at Apogee Stadium on Monday afternoon as the hours ticked down to UNT 's Tuesday deadline . `` I have n't renewed and am on the fence if I will or not , '' Jackson said . `` A month from now , we may hear something different about where things stand . Right now , we do n't know what things will look like when the season gets here . '' The dilemma is one many UNT fans are wrestling with ahead of the program 's ticket renewal deadline . Earlier this spring , the school extended the deadline from April 24 to Tuesday and has launched a season ticket assurance program in an effort to lure its core supporters like Jackson back to Apogee . In the event games are canceled due to COVID-19 , fans who purchased season tickets will have the opportunity to apply those payments to future UNT games , convert payments to donations to the Mean Green Scholarship Fund or receive a refund . The question now for UNT is if its fans will renew their tickets at a time when the status of the season and seating capacity are in doubt . Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told schools across the state earlier this month that they should plan on operating at 50 % capacity in football stadiums this fall . He scaled back Texas ' aggressive reopening last week by closing bars and reducing restaurant capacity from 75 % to 50 % following the rise in COVID-19 cases . UNT established a pecking order for fans should it be forced to reduce capacity at Apogee , which seats 30,850 . Students and fans who purchase season tickets will be given first priority when it comes to seats . UNT averaged 21,358 fans per game last season , well over 50 % of capacity . UNT athletic director Wren Baker said the school has seen a substantial increase in calls leading up to the deadline , but is trending behind last year when it comes to season ticket sales . The drop is one UNT officials anticipated due to the uncertainty surrounding the season . The school does not release ticket sales figures until after the season . `` Obviously , there are still lingering questions , but our ticket assurance plan has given fans comfort that they can request refunds if they are n't satisfied with our final operational plans , '' Baker said in an email . `` It 's important for us to get a sense of the renewals and total season tickets so that we can plan appropriately on the various possibilities related to potential capacity caps . '' Steve Boedeker and Adam Driver are among the fans UNT can count on returning . The pair of old college friends are among a group of five families who pay a combined $ 26,000 per year to rent an Apogee luxury box . `` My group of friends is excited and ready for football , '' Boedeker said . `` We hope that when the season gets here , things will have calmed down . '' Boedeker is among the residents of North Texas who has recovered from a case of COVID-19 . He 's hoping the antibodies in his system will protect him for at least a few months . Driver is confident UNT officials will do all they can to make Apogee safe for fans . He will be back in his suite when the season kicks off . `` You have your die-hards . It would take an act of Congress to keep us away , '' Driver said . `` I 'm concerned about the fans who have had the shutdown affect their jobs . They will think twice when they do n't see the end to COVID-19 in sight .

Edit2 : I asked the developers and the most simultaneous players they had so far was 54 . And there seems to be a hard to track down bug right now that makes it difficult to add much more .

Or , Richard . To most of the world he was Little Richard , sexy wild rock rebel to sexy wild rock rebels . It 's hard to imagine the existence of McCartney 's whoos , Axl 's grit , Prince 's androgyny or Hendrix 's flash without Macon , Ga. native Richard Penniman . For 18 years , Muscle Shoals musician Holly , who 's also toured or recorded with everyone from Amazing Rhythm Aces to Pegi Young to Gregg Allman and beyond , was the guitarist in Little Richard 's band . On May 10 , the day after Little Richard died at age 87 from cancer , I talked with Holly about his friend and longtime employer . Below are edited excerpts . Kelvin , my condolences . This is a big loss for rock & roll , and I 'm sure even more so for you . I appreciate it , man . He was a great friend to me and a lot of us really . I 'm going to really miss him . I have n't had time to really process it . What did you enjoy most about playing music with Little Richard ? There 's just so much . Well number one , just getting to play with such an icon of music , you know ? Of course , over the years when we became friends you tend to forget who he is . He 's just Richard . But I would pinch myself sometimes , because I stood right next to him onstage , we 'd be playing and I 'd go , `` Damn , that 's Little Richard . '' -LSB- Laughs -RSB- From the moment we hit -LRB- the stage -RRB- , man , it was like doing aerobics for 90 minutes , it was just nonstop boogie-woogie and here 's a man that 's , well , he was still in his fifties when I started with him but -LRB- later -RRB- he was in his late seventies and he 's got more energy than we do . It was mind boggling . He was just such an entertainer . He would n't quit until he just had the crowd whipped into a frenzy . Where were you set up onstage with Little Richard ? If you 're looking at the stage , I would be slightly to the right but I would always be right by the piano . As time went on and it kind of happened naturally , but he had a tendency to start talking a lot which was kind of his nature but I would try to reel him in and call songs to him . We never had a setlist . We 'd always start with `` Good Golly Miss Molly '' and we would end with `` Long Tall Sally '' but the space between there it was always , whatever ... You just mentioned two of his iconic hits . What were a couple of your other favorite songs to play live with Little Richard ? Well , I always loved `` Lucille , '' I loved the groove , the beat . And he did too , he always used to call it `` that choo choo train beat '' because he said he was inspired by hearing the train out behind his mama 's house where they lived , going by . And then there was a blues song called `` Directly From My Heart '' that used to kind of cut me loose on , just a slow blues song but the groove was great and had a really nice line that we would play . But those were probably my two favorite ones we did . For people 's who are just familiar with Richard 's signature songs , what are deeper cuts you 'd recommend them to check out too ? There was one called `` Miss Ann '' that was really cool . Another blues song called `` Going Home Tomorrow , '' that was a really good one . `` Rip It Up '' was a great one , `` Slippin ' and Slidin '' . There are just so many of them , a lot of them it was the grooves the beats , they just had this infectious groove . Of course , a lot of it came from the boogie-woogie beat . That first album -LRB- `` Here 's Little Richard '' -RRB- , that he did in New Orleans and he had all those New Orleans musicians playing on there , Earl Palmer on drums , Earl Bostic all those guys . They were basically Fats Domino 's band , but they just had that funk on them man , a way of playing that boogie-woogie beat their own way . And of course , Richard 's vocal style it was just so in your face . Speaking of his vocals , lots of people know Richard 's energy as a performer and singer , and that he was pretty much the first flamboyant rock & roll star ... Oh , most definitely . But what 's something about his piano playing casual listeners may not notice ? Everything he played was always in the key of C , F or G . If he started playing something , they were going to be in one of those three keys , but he had a way of playing octaves on the piano with his right hand and his hand would move so fast and he would always hit the right notes . He could just really boogie on that piano . And he was n't trained , a lot of it he just picked up on his own - I think he told me one time there was this old black man and he used to go by his house and hear him play and peak through the window and one of the neighbors would always chase him off . Richard was a different kind of kid . He was born with one leg shorter than the other , had a big head , kids always teased him and whatnot . What was your very first exposure to Little Richard ? The movie `` The Girl Ca n't Help It , '' -LRB- seeing it -RRB- in the early '60s . When you and Richard would talk , what would he call you , by name ? I have kind of an unusual name , Kelvin , I do n't know if it 's that unusual , but at first , he had a hard time saying my name and it was Cleveland . And then as time went on , I was always Calvin and I 'd always trying to correct him humorously and he 'd tell me to shut up , you know what his big thing was , `` Shut up ! '' I said , `` Man you can call me whatever you want as long as you spell my name right on the check . '' But it was so funny because he would write checks to everybody for their pay , but he would write all over the checks `` Paid In Full , '' `` Paid In Full , '' because he 'd been ripped off so many times over the years by different people he was just making sure he had his I 's dotted and T 's crossed . You mentioned him always saying `` Shut up ! '' -LRB- one of Little Richard 's catch phrases -RRB- , when I think of him , I think of his sense of humor ... Oh man , he was the king of one liners . He was so funny . There were times we 'd be talking on the phone I 'd be laughing so hard I had to hang up . A lot of it was his timing . One day on the bus , I think we were in Germany or somewhere like that and I had gotten a sandwich and he comes up behind me on the bus and asks me what I 'm eating and I say `` I got a roast beef sandwich . He said , `` Oh , you got onions on there . You know onion is a medicine . You eat an onion you wo n't get no bunion , '' just stupid stuff like that . He always said , `` Calvin , you the tree and the trunk . '' -LSB- Laughs -RSB- What guitar rig did you play touring with Richard ? At the time , I had one of those Line 6 Pods -LRB- sound effects processors -RRB- , and I had some setting on there I used , a couple ones that had some slap back echo and a couple other ones that had some overdrive for solos . But I used two Vox AC30s -LRB- guitar amps -RRB- . It was an extremely loud band . There were times it was so loud my eyeballs would cross . And you have to understand we have two of everything in the band . He had two bass players that were totally badasses , two drummers - everybody in the band was badasses - a horn section , another keyboard player , another guitar player , so it was a big band . Richard used a Yamaha MIDI grand piano and it would be blasting through the monitors . What about guitars ? At first I was playing my Strat , which I still have but retired it because it wore out and needs a little work but then I got a G&L endorsement and started using a red Legacy , like a Strat , and then I got a Telecaster and that became my number one and pretty much still is . That guitar has been all over the world a million times with him . I even ran over it with my car by accident and I thought I 'd broke and got out , got it out and it was in a gig bag too , pulled it out and the damn thing was still in tune . Any interesting notes Richard gave you on what to play , how to play , when to play ? Or did he basically give you carte blanche ? He pretty much just wanted me to be me , man . Every now and then he 'd say , `` Just do Chuck Berry . '' He and Chuck did n't get along , there was a rivalry between the two of them that goes way , way back . But he never really did ... In fact , he always complemented me . One time we were on a show with Aretha Franklin and I 'd probably been in his band two or three years at that point but I was standing on the side of the stage watching Aretha and he came up behind me and was standing behind me and he said , `` I want you to always be my guitar player . '' So , it was like instant job security . But you never know how long a gig 's going to last , I had no idea I was going to be with him as long as I was . Besides Germany and the States , what are some other places you toured together ? For some reason I do n't know why we never went to the Pacific side . We had so many offers to go to Australia , offers to go to China and Russia - but mainly it was Canada , South America a few times , of course U.S.A. , we went to Europe a lot . One time we did a three week tour of just England , we went all over the damn place . What were some of Richard 's interests outside music ? Like was he into any particular TV shows or sports teams or whatever ? Richard watched The Weather Channel . Any time I went in his room he 'd have The Weather Channel on and of course he was extremely religious . He definitely had Jesus in his heart . He was really a kind guy . There were many times say we were in an airport or somewhere , he could just sense if some people were in distress . One morning sticks out in my mind . A lady and her kid were in there and she was crying and then he sent Walter his bodyguard to find out what was wrong with here and she said she was a hundred something dollars short to get a plane ticket to where she needed to go and she did n't know what she was going to do and her baby was crying . And so , Richard gave Walter his credit card and he went up there and paid for the whole ticket . Just things like that . Many times , I 'd see him a $ 100 bill in somebody 's hand or the band 's kids if they had birthday , he 'd give them a $ 100 bill . He was generous . Little Richard was a massive influence on rock 's biggest artists , from The Beatles to Rolling Stones to Bob Dylan . When you worked with Richard would any of those people come around ? Well yeah . I 've met so many of my musical heroes through Richard , it 's unreal . Yeah thee would come around . In fact , I went to the 50th Grammys with Richard , he was doing a thing with John Fogerty and Jerry Lee Lewis . Richard wanted me to be there in case he needed me to play with him . I said , `` John 's got two guitar players in his band besides himself , I doubt very seriously ... '' He said , `` I want you to come . '' Long story short I was standing outside the dressing room door and looking down the hallway and this voice behind me says , `` Hey mate , can you get me back to see the boss ? '' I turned around and it was Ringo -LRB- Starr , Beatles drummer -RRB- . It was him and his wife -LRB- model , actress and `` James Bond '' girl , Barbara Bach -RRB- , Yoko Ono , Sean Lennon , George Harrison 's widow , George Martin 's son . It was an extended Beatle family . But yeah , I 've met all of them . David Bowie . The list is endless . Richard was loved by both rock stars and fans the world over . But is it bittersweet now when you see all these media tributes and people on social media posting about him ? Because he 's gone . What 's your take on that ? Yeah it is . It 's different for me because I knew him so well personally . I 've seen a lot of people posting things that just are n't true or they just got their stories all twisted up . It 's just funny to me how people will post something and not find out what the real truth is . There were a lot of people who posted yesterday that acted like they knew when I knew they actually did not know him . Just things like that , it kind of rubs me the wrong way sometimes . I knew Richard had been sick for a while , it 's been a gradually thing with him . I knew the time was coming , just did n't know when , but I got the phone call yesterday morning around five o'clock . Who did you get the call from about Richard -LRB- passing -RRB- ? His family , management ... ? It was Richard 's brother , Peyton . Since you 're from Alabama , did Richard ever mention his recording in Muscle Shoals back in the day or his time at Oakwood College in Huntsville ? Uh , not much . There were a lot of times when we would do soundchecks ... Sometimes he would n't come to soundcheck which was great because if he did show up we 'd end up being there for like three hours playing . Many , many times we 'd be soundchecking and I 'd come up with some little guitar riff and Richard would go , `` Ooh , I love that '' and we 'd all just in on this riff and he would start making stuff up . I said , `` Man you need to cut a new record , '' I mean a real Little Richard record . And he was just so weary about that . He said , `` I ca n't top the old stuff , and I 'd be like , `` Well you know what it ai n't really about that , Rich . '' And he would just be his usual self and tell me to shut up . -LSB- Laughs -RSB- But I was always trying to get him to cut a new record because they were all doing it . Jerry Lee Lewis did it , even Chuck Berry cut a new record before he passed . But he never would . I did a lot of sessions with him for different stuff . We did movie stuff , TV theme songs , we did all kinds of different things but for some reason I could n't convince him to cut a real record with original music . Just had no interest in doing it It 's well documented Richard loved the music of Otis Redding . I 've also read he liked Prince 's music , Michael Jackson 's . Any music by other artists you recall him liking ? You know what he liked more than anything ? Country music . Like , Hank Williams ? He loved Hank Williams , in fact we played two or three Hank songs during our set . He loved Bill Monroe . He always called it `` the white man 's blues '' but he loved that - the old country not the new country . What Hank songs did you all play ? We did `` I Saw The Light , '' `` Jambalaya '' ... Some of the time without even playing the playing he would start singing a Hank song and I would jump in on the guitar and the band would follow . But he loved gospel music , Mahalia Jackson , in fact Richard cut several gospel albums back in the '60s when he gave his life back to the Lord . What years were you with Richard ? Started with him in ' 94 . The last show was in Las Vegas . Want is something about Little Richard you 'd want people to know ? He truly loved all his fans . He would always try to accommodate anybody that wanted an autograph . He just knew that they were responsible for making him who he was .

Mardones , also known as `` The Voice , '' died at his California home on Monday after nearly two decades of struggling with Parkinson 's disease . He was 73 . He was best known for `` Into the Night , '' one of the few songs to reach the top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100 twice . The rock ballad appeared on his 1980 album `` Never Run , Never Hide , '' and hit No. 11 that year ; nine years later , an Arizona radio DJ 's `` Where Are They Now ? '' special helped propel the song back to popularity , ascending to No. 20 in America in 1989 . Between those nine years , he struggled with cocaine and alcohol , and stopped performing after his 1981 album flopped . After his son was born in 1985 , he moved to Syracuse to get clean . He successfully kicked the drug habit and began performing again with a local band , The Hurricanes , drawing large crowds of 15,000 at Long Branch Park and 24,000 at Weedsport Speedway . `` When I was addicted to drugs , Syracuse opened its arms to me , '' he told syracuse.com in 2017 , before playing his final show at the Turning Stone Resort Casino . `` It gave me my life back . The fans never wavered . The radio stations played my songs . '' To this day , the opening notes of `` Into the Night '' are instantly recognizable to ` 80s music fans and the lyrics -- starting with the lines `` She 's just sixteen years old / Leave her alone , they say '' -- are still sometimes debated . Here are five little-known facts about `` Into the Night '' by Benny Mardones : 1 . `` Into the Night '' song meaning What does `` Into the Night '' mean ? Is it about a creepy older guy hitting on a 16-year-old girl ? Mardones , who co-wrote the song with Robert Tepper , was 33 when it first came out . Tepper , best known for performing `` No Easy Way Out '' on the `` Rocky IV '' soundtrack , was 30 . And it did n't help that the music video shows Mardones watching a younger woman through her bedroom window , eventually taking her on a magic carpet ride and kissing her . But Mardones has explained many times over the years that the song is not statutory or even sexual . While living in New York 's Spanish Harlem in 1979 , he was inspired by three teen neighbors whose father had scored a Broadway hit and ran off with a chorus line girl . He offered to help them and their mother with the rent , paying the kids to run errands and clean his apartment ; he gave the 16-year-old , a girl named Heidi , $ 50 a week to walk his dog named Zanky . In 2011 , he elaborated on their platonic relationship in an interview with SongFacts.com : `` So one night Robert Tepper and I were up writing songs ... And in she walks , 16 years old , dressed for school in a miniskirt , little stacked heels , adorable , 16-going-on-21 . She said , ` You 've been up all night ? ' and of course it was obvious . I said , ` Yeah , we have . ' She says , ` Okay , come on , Zanky , ' and she walks the dog out . When she leaves and goes out the door , my partner goes , ` Oh , my God . ' I said , ` Hey , Bob . She 's just 16 years old , leave her alone . ' And literally five minutes later I said , ` Play that lick again , Bobby . ' So he played the lick and I went -LRB- singing -RRB- , ` she 's just 16 years old , leave her alone , they say . ' Then I thought about her dad and what he had done , and that 's where I got ` Separated by fools who do n't know what love is yet . ' The chorus was , ` you 're too young for me , but if I could fly , I 'd pick you up and take you into the night and show you love like you 've never seen . ' Then the verse ` It 's like having it all and letting it show . It 's like having a dream where nobody has a heart . It 's like having it all and watching it fall apart . ' Because his success was not the family 's success ; it was just his . ` I ca n't measure my love there 's nothing compared to it ' - it was all about the abandonment of this family and this 16-year-old girl . '' They remained friends for years , sending Christmas cards long after she married and moved to Puerto Rico . 2 . More than just a one-hit wonder `` Into the Night '' is one of just 10 songs to reach the top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100 twice . Others include `` The Twist '' by Chubby Checker -LRB- 1960 and 1962 -RRB- ; `` Stand By Me '' by Ben E. King -LRB- 1961 and 1986 , thanks to the movie of the same name -RRB- ; `` Unchained Melody '' by the Righteous Brothers -LRB- 1965 and 1990 , after the song appeared in Patrick Swayze 's `` Ghost '' -RRB- ; and `` Bohemian Rhapsody '' by Queen -LRB- 1976 and 1992 , after the epic lip sync scene in `` Wayne 's World 2 '' -RRB- . But `` Into the Night '' actually charted three times , according to Billboard . DJ Eric Kupper 's 2019 dance remix peaked at No. 35 on the Dance Club Songs charts . Despite being his only true `` hit , '' Mardones achieved another form of chart success : The song spent 37 weeks -LRB- nonconsecutive -RRB- on the Billboard Hot 100 chart , breaking the record set by Laura Branigan 's `` Gloria , '' according to WFGR . It spent 20 weeks on the chart in 1980 and 17 weeks in 1989 . -LRB- The record has since been broken by other songs ; Syracuse native Post Malone 's 2019 release `` Circles '' spent 39 weeks in the top 10 . -RRB- 3 . Blacklisted ? Mardones said it was tough for `` Into the Night '' to become a success because radio stations either worried about the song 's subject matter -- or had issues with his race . `` When it first was released , R&B stations all over America thought I was black . Then they found out I was white and they dropped the record , '' he told SongFacts.com in 2011 . `` White radio was afraid to touch it because they thought it was about me dating a 16-year-old girl at my age . So Polydor Records sent out like 3,000 letters to radio stations across the country explaining what the song was really about . And the song got added and almost instantly started playing all over America . '' 4 . Usher and other versions Mardones has recorded multiple versions of `` Into the Night '' over the years , including a 1989 re-recording on his 1989 self-titled album for Curb Records and an acoustic version for a 2002 compilation . There 's also a 2006 hip-hop version with Conrad Hilton -LRB- no relation to the Hilton Hotels family -RRB- and 2019 club remixes by Eric Kupper and DJ duo Dirty Werk . A handful of artists have also covered the song , including Jamaican reggae singer Junior Tucker . His 1991 song , retitled `` 16 -LRB- Into The Night -RRB- , '' was a minor hit in Australia . Usher -- the R&B superstar behind hits `` OMG , '' `` Yeah ! '' and `` U Remind Me '' -- sampled the track on `` Making Love -LRB- Into the Night -RRB- , '' featured on his 2010 release `` Raymond v. Raymond . '' The album went platinum and sold more than 2 million copies worldwide . 5 . Breaking Bad The song played in a 2009 episode of `` Breaking Bad . '' On season 2 , episode 4 -LRB- '' Down '' -RRB- , `` Into the Night '' plays at a convenience store where Walter White -LRB- Bryan Cranston -RRB- meets with Jesse Pinkman -LRB- Aaron Paul -RRB- . `` Into the Night '' was also featured on a 2014 episode of Aubrey Plaza 's series `` Life After Beth '' and in the 2016 movie `` Nerve '' starring Emma Roberts and Dave Franco . Mardones is survived by his wife , Jane , as well as his son Michael and sister Louise . A memorial service will be announced in the near future , according to a statement .", "seg_content_paragraph_starts": "0 29 61 146 216 271 321 336 345 440 537 552 879 898 906 1021 1054 1147 1151 1185 1282 1288 1356 1394 1454 1458 1509 1546 1565", "simhash": "ccd59787934047716d69745fcb5678e0", "spacy_content_loc": ["New York", "California", "Arizona", "America", "Hurricanes", "Long Branch Park", "the Turning Stone Resort Casino", "New York 's", "Spanish Harlem", "Broadway", "Puerto Rico"], "spacy_content_num": ["one", "20", "100", "20", "15,000", "24,000", "five", "1", "first", "30", "three", "50", "2", "one", "one", "just 10", "20", "100", "three", "35"], "spacy_content_org": ["Mardones", "Syracuse", "Weedsport Speedway", "Syracuse", "Mardones", "Mardones", "Mardones", "the Righteous Brothers", "Billboard", "Mardones"], "spacy_content_otr": ["`` The Voice", "`` Into the Night", "`` Never Run , Never Hide", "` Where Are They Now", "`` Into the Night ''", "`` Into the Night ''", "` Into the Night", "` Into the Night", "` No Easy Way Out", "` Into the Night", "`` The Twist ''", "` Stand By Me", "` Unchained Melody ''", "` Ghost ''", "`` Bohemian Rhapsody ''", "` Into the Night"], "spacy_content_per": ["Benny Mardones", "Benny Mardones", "Robert Tepper", "Tepper", "Heidi", "Zanky", "Robert Tepper", "Zanky", "Bob", "Bobby", "Chubby Checker", "Ben E.

Island Glow and Three Crosses Distilling Co. joined forces again to put on the second annual Barks , Bourbon , and Bronze fundraiser on Thursday , July 23 in the Village . The event saw dogs and their owners coming together for an entertaining night out at the distillery . The event raised more than $ 1,500 through a combination of T-shirt sales , raffle prizes , purchases of vendor services/retail , and cash donations , as well as bringing in a sizeable amount of dog and cat food donations , said Michelle Walters , co-coordinator of the event and owner of Island Glow . This year 's event surpassed the fundraiser held in 2019 , she added . The 2020 event had a food truck , vendors , music , and a visit by special guest Dot Kelly , Miss Virginia 2019-2020 . Owners could also bring their dogs on a leash and there were special treats for sale . `` This was about awareness for the animal shelter because of the expense that goes into the care of these animals -- to feed them and their medical expenses , '' Walters said . Powhatan Animal Shelter has a solid reputation for working to save every animal it can by promoting adoptions and working with other agencies and animal rescue groups , said Michelle Davenport , event co-coordinator and co-owner of Three Crosses . They designated the funds to be used mostly for veterinarian expenses so an animal would n't have to be euthanized just because it needs a procedure , she said . The biggest challenge in planning the fundraiser in 2020 was COVID-19 and the uncertainty it brought , Davenport said . They worked to make it as safe as possible while still having fun , she said . `` It has been a game of pivoting whenever needed , '' she said . With all of the unknowns -- especially COVID-19 and an impending storm on the night of the fundraiser -- both women said they were pleased with the outcome of the 2020 fundraiser and are looking forward to planning next year 's event . Cpl. Ashley Gatewood said Barks , Bourbon , and Bronze was another great example of how the community supports Powhatan Animal Control 's efforts . `` Powhatan is a great county and I appreciate the community . They support us and they are constantly donating , '' she said . The funds raised in the 2019 event were used partially to spruce up the meet and greet room to improve the adoption experience , and the rest went to help with medical procedures . Gatewood anticipates this year 's proceeds will be used mostly for medical procedures . The event also raises awareness of the shelter . As far as the impact of COVID-19 on the shelter , Gatewood said that when the pandemic gained speed , the shelter saw fewer strays and an increase in adoptions because more people were home to take care of the animals . `` It has slowed down some because people are unaware of their futures . So we are trying to pick that back up and bring more people in , '' Gatewood said , although she added the shelter is not currently at full capacity . Walters first suggested the fundraiser to Davenport about a year ago .

'' Pony Bird 's annual Great Taste fundraiser , which offers people the chance to sample food and beverages from local restaurants and wineries , was supposed to be held March 21 , but was called off when large gatherings were banned because of the COVID-19 pandemic . Since it was unclear when large gatherings could be held again , Pony Bird changed the annual fundraiser to an online auction , which was held May 11-15 . Sucharski said two custom fire pits drew some intense bidding . One fire pit featured the St. Louis Blues logo and the other the Kansas City Chiefs logo `` Both did very well , '' she said . `` The Blues fire pit went for $ 500 and the Chiefs fire pit went for $ 400 .

They both ended up winning separate artwork . Hillsboro Title actually won several pieces of artwork , which are now featured in their offices . It 's great advocacy for the individuals we support .

Thunberg , Luisa Neubauer from Germany and Belgians Anuna de Wever van der Heyden and Adélaïde Charlier were accompanied by a handful of climate protesters as they arrived at the chancellery for a 90-minute meeting Thursday , the first high-profile talks the youth activists have held with a world leader since the start of the pandemic . `` We are here , we are loud , because our future 's being stolen , '' the protesters chanted as Thunberg was mobbed by photographers . The 17-year-old shot to fame after starting her solo protests outside the Swedish parliament two years ago . Students around the world began following her lead , staging regular large protests , and Thunberg was invited to speak to political and business leaders at U.N. conferences and the annual World Economic Forum in Davos . But the coronavirus outbreak has prevented the that Thunberg inspired from holding its mass rallies in recent months , dampening its public profile . The activists sought a meeting with Merkel because Germany currently holds the six-month rotating presidency of the European Union , which together with Britain accounts for 22 % of all man-made greenhouse gas emissions . Merkel has in the past lauded the youth activists for putting pressure on politicians to act against global warming . Climate campaigners argue that governments around the world are doing too little to curb the emissions that are heating up the atmosphere . In , Thunberg and others called for numerous measures including ending financing for oil and gas projects and setting binding annual carbon budgets . Merkel 's spokeswoman , Ulrike Demmer , said Wednesday that the German government recently agreed to to cut emissions by up to 55 % over the coming decade compared with 1990 levels . It also backs plans for an EU Green Deal and for making Europe the first `` climate neutral '' continent by 2050 . `` The subject -LRB- of climate change -RRB- is an issue of central importance for the entire German government , '' Demmer said . `` As such , an exchange with -LRB- the activists -RRB- is certainly beneficial .

France 's Green party and its left-wing allies made significant gains in the second round of voting , capturing cities such as Lyon , Strasbourg and Besançon . On Monday , Macron promised 15 billion euros -LRB- $ 16.7 billion -RRB- in new climate-related financing after meeting with a citizens ' group that he convened earlier this year in response to criticism that he was n't doing enough to battle climate change . The citizens ' group gave him a new list of climate proposals drawn from an ambitious report it compiled , which includes recommendations on fighting CO2 emissions by weening the French off solo car rides and proposing alternatives such as electric cars , as well as capping the harmful effects of air travel . Travel produces 30 % of greenhouse gases in France . The yellow vest economic justice protests that brought France to its knees for months in 2018 and 2019 knocked some of Macron 's green agenda off track as it was triggered by opposition to a new fuel tax that he planned to help fund the climate fight . Earlier this year , Macron tried to woo green voters by calling the battle against climate change and environmental destruction `` the fight of the century . '' The words came during a February visit to a melting glacier in the French Alps but it was condemned as a hollow electoral stunt by environmental campaigners .

The footage , which was retrieved from body cameras worn by former officers Thomas Lane and J. Alexander Keung and leaked to the Daily Mail , is striking for the number of times that Floyd and his companions attempt to calm the officers by bringing up Floyd 's mental health . It shows Floyd explaining to the officer that he had been shot before , implying that he may suffer from PTSD -LRB- post-traumatic stress disorder -RRB- from previous interactions with law enforcement ; he also mentions that his mother recently passed away , indicating possible mental health issues related to stress and grief ; his ex-girlfriend , when asked by Lane why Floyd is being `` squirrelly , '' gesticulates that Floyd has mental health problems because of `` a thing going on about the police '' ; and Floyd himself tells the officers that he has `` claustrophobia '' and `` anxiety . '' Despite the obvious plausible signs that Floyd may have suffered from mental illnesses , and even though he was being accused of a non-violent offense -LRB- he allegedly used a counterfeit $ 20 bill at a nearby grocery store -RRB- , Chauvin knelt on Floyd 's neck for more than eight minutes . Floyd died soon thereafter . Floyd 's horrific and unjust death has prompted a national re-evaluation of the function and nature of the US police force , including calls to defund the police . Many activists have rightly pointed out that a vast number of calls to police are mental health calls , which police are generally not well-trained to handle -LRB- as is evident in Chauvin 's case -RRB- . According to the National Library of Medicine from the National Institutes of Health , an estimated `` six to 10 percent of all police contacts with the public in the U.S. involve persons with serious mental illnesses . '' The reported added that the evidence regarding whether mental illnesses increase the likelihood of arrest is `` equivocal . '' `` I believe -LSB- police -RSB- training and their protocol should include asking ... if they have any health conditions that we need to know about , '' Dr. Jameca Woody-Cooper , a psychologist in St. Louis , told Salon , pointing out that there are non-psychological health conditions like epilepsy that could influence a citizen 's encounter with police officers . `` Then he volunteered that information -- about his prior history with police , and being shot , and one thing that he mentioned was trauma . Then I think his friends said that as well , that he 'd been shot before . Then he told them he was afraid . Then he said he was claustrophobic . Then he said he has anxiety , as he 's crying . '' `` You do n't have to be a trained mental health professional to know that he 's volunteering his health information and they ignored each and every piece of it , '' Woody-Cooper added . Dr. David Reiss , a professor at Yale Child Study Center , was troubled that the officers reacted with such aggression toward Floyd even though he and the other people in his car clearly communicated that he had mental health problems . `` It 's really the officer 's -- or whoever is approaching the person -- responsibility to identify the situation they 're dealing with . And the person who is in it , the only thing they can do is communicate , '' Reiss explained . `` This is the best they can do . ` This is what I 'm experiencing , or this is what I 'm dealing with . Help me beyond that . ' It 's really up to the responding person to do something . There 's not much else the person could do other than to inform , ' I have an issue , help me with this . ' And sometimes they 're not capable of doing that , but there 's not much else they can really do . '' As Woody-Cooper explained to Salon , this is where the issue of discrimination against people with mental illnesses intersects with racism . `` If you 're a black person in America , you do n't have the luxury of saying that you have a mental issue that would preclude you from reacting a certain way , '' Woody-Cooper pointed out . `` That 's a luxury that 's not afforded to black people in America . '' Dr. Phillip Atiba Goff , co-founder and CEO of the Center for Policing Equity -LRB- CPE -RRB- and an African-American Studies and Psychology Professor at Yale University , elaborated on the officers ' various missed chances to recognize Floyd 's vulnerable state and interact with him in a way that would have been beneficial to all parties . Like Woody-Cooper and Reiss , Goff pointed to how Floyd attempted to communicate that he had mental health issues in order to protect himself . Goff added that this goes a long way toward explaining why America needs to have mental health professionals in situations like this , as well as law enforcement officers , so that they can people with psychological conditions can be treated fairly . `` It 's not just Mr. Floyd who indicated that he is claustrophobic , he 's been shot before , he 's exhibiting symptoms of trauma , '' Goff told Salon . `` His ex-partner is also there saying that he 's got mental health issues , and in those situations , there 's an opportunity without endangering the officers to de-escalate . '' As any social worker or ER nurse can attest , there are different protocols for dealing with deliberate violent criminality and those suffering from mental illness . Yet most police , at least as they exist today , seem to flatten the distinction . As Goff pointed out , an officer `` pointed a gun as soon as -LSB- Floyd -RSB- opens the door '' -- a vast and unwarranted provocation for someone accused of a minor petty crime . `` There is nothing in the video that I saw that would justify that to have escalated . '' Goff said that proning Floyd was the wrong move for someone who is reporting trauma and difficulty breathing , that it `` is not something that you do for someone who is going to be hyperventilating . All of those things would be a violation if this person was considered to be concerning being dangerous or concerning being violent in a mental health facility . And that 's part of the reason why it 's important that , when you have someone who is presenting with mental health symptoms , you have someone who is trained to deal with someone presenting a mental health symptoms present . '' Activists ' calls to defund the police have often gone hand-in-hand with calls to reallocate policing funds to mental health and social services . Indeed , the experts Salon spoke with said it would be a social boon to have mental health professionals , social workers or others from non-law enforcement backgrounds present in handling certain criminal situations . `` A lot of departments , if they get a call and they know it 's going to be a mental health issue , they 'll send a social worker or a mental health professional with the team as part of the police team to help with that , '' Reiss explained . `` Now obviously you ca n't do that if it 's something that just happens suddenly , but the officers should be trained and should use that training to know when to de-escalate as opposed when they should assume it 's going to be a violent , hostile situation . '' Dr. Laurence Miller , a clinical , forensic and police psychologist based in Palm Beach County , Florida , disagrees , arguing that it would not be a good idea to have mental health professionals accompany every police call . `` I think it would be a misuse of resources to insist that a mental health practitioner accompany of police officers to every call , not to mention the liability issue , because many of these calls can turn extremely dangerous ... most mental health professionals are the ones that I know are not going to just walk into a scene without knowing what the consequences might be , '' Miller told Salon . The incident with Floyd is hardly the first time the nature of police interaction with the mentally ill has been thrust into the public eye . Social justice advocates have drawn attention to the case of Matthew Rushin , an African American autistic man who is serving a 50-year prison sentence -LRB- a judge ordered that he had to serve 10 of them -RRB- for severely wounding a 72-year-old man in an automobile accident . Although no one disputes Rushin 's guilt , mental health advocates have argued that he was pressured into signing a plea deal he does not understand because of his autism , attention deficit disorder and traumatic brain injury , and that his sentence was out of proportion to his offense . There is also the case of Neli Latson , a Virginian special-education student who is also black and on the autism spectrum , who was accused of `` suspicious '' activity while sitting outside of a library -LRB- he did not have a gun , as the anonymous caller claimed -RRB- . After the officer grabbed him several times during their interaction , Latson lashed out and injured the officer , resulting in a jail sentence where he was often held in solitary confinement for over 100 days . At one point Latson was Tasered and strapped to a restraint chair . `` People equate mental illness with violence , '' Reiss told Salon when asked about how biases against mentally ill individuals may have factored into what happened with Floyd . `` The reality is that people with mental illnesses are much , much more likely to be the victims of violence than the perpetrator . Yes , some of the violence is because of mental illness , but that 's a small percentage . Yet we tend to act as if that 's inherent to mental illness when the reverse is true . '' Woody-Cooper opened up about how she felt watching the latest Floyd footage as an African-American mother who helps mentally ill people . `` As a mental health professional , just watching that was heartbreaking , '' Woody-Cooper explained . `` I 'm a parent . I have two sons , African American sons that are teenagers , and watching this was traumatic for me . So I can only imagine what it 's going to be for the masses . '' Her conclusion was the same one reached by many people : `` It tells me as an African American person in this country that truly my life does n't matter . '' Goff , by contrast , firmly contextualized Floyd 's mistreatment in terms of racism . `` One of the prejudices that folks have against African Americans is it 's harder to see when they are in mental distress , Instead they get upgraded as angry , violent , scary , but not that there is something going on inside of them , which is painful , '' Goff explained . `` Our pain is reinterpreted as a danger to other people .

Both Garner 's and Floyd 's altercations with police were recorded and posted on social media for the world to view , but one question remains : How many of these incidents are happening that are n't caught on video ? According to a new study , the answer is at least 70 over the last decade . Researchers for a study conducted by the New York Times found that at least 70 people , ages ranging from 19 to 65 , died in police custody after saying the words `` I ca n't breathe . '' The study found that more than half of those killed were Black people and that the majority of them were stopped or detained over nonviolent infractions . From the Times : Dozens of videos , court documents , autopsies and police reports reviewed in these cases -- involving a range of people who died in confrontations with officers on the street , in local jails or in their homes -- show a pattern of aggressive tactics that ignored prevailing safety precautions while embracing dubious science that suggested that people pleading for air do not need urgent intervention . In some of the `` I ca n't breathe '' cases , officers restrained detainees by the neck , hogtied them , Tased them multiple times or covered their heads with mesh hoods designed to prevent spitting or biting . Most frequently , officers pushed them face down on the ground and held them prone with their body weight . Not all of the cases involved police restraints . Some were deaths that occurred after detainees ' protests that they could not breathe -- perhaps because of a medical problem or drug intoxication -- were discounted or ignored . Some people pleaded for hours for help before they died . The study noted that often what leads to suspects choking to death while being detained is police officers ' assumption that they 're lying or exaggerating when they complain that they ca n't breathe . The report pointed to an example of this in Montgomery County Jail in Dayton , Ohio , where , in 2018 , a sign hung on a bulletin board that read , `` If you can talk then you obviously can fucking breathe . '' That same jail ended up having to pay a $ 3.5 million settlement last year over the 2012 death of inmate Robert Richardson , who had been locked up for failing to show up for a child support hearing and died after his complaints of trouble breathing were ignored . According to the Times , former Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn said in a 2014 deposition that the `` If you can talk , you can breathe '' idea was once part of officers ' training and persisted as a `` common understanding '' among cops even after it was found to be wrong . The study 's findings suggest that in nearly half the cases , the detainees `` were already at risk as a result of drug intoxication '' and some had underlying health issues , but that really does n't matter because , as the study suggests , the issue is n't just why detainees were having trouble breathing , but how officers responded -LRB- or did n't -RRB- when their suspects told them they could n't breathe . Earlier this month , The Root reported on the case of 42-year-old Derrick Scott , a black man who died of a collapsed lung while in police custody . After Scott told his arresting officers , `` I ca n't breathe , '' one of them literally responded , `` I do n't care '' and another responded by telling him he could `` breathe just fine . '' The Root also reported the case of Javier Ambler , a black man who repeatedly told police officers , `` I have congestive heart failure . I ca n't breathe . '' He also died . In Ambler 's case , officers responded by repeatedly using their tasers on him as he struggled and begged them to stop . From Garner to Floyd to Ambler to Scott to Manuel Ellis , the list goes on and on . Not that the point needs to be driven any harder , but here 's a partial list of victims uncovered by the Times study over the last five years : In 2015 , Calvon Reid died in Coconut Creek , Fla. , after officers fired 10 shots at him with a Taser . In 2016 , Fermin Vincent Valenzuela was asphyxiated after police officers in Anaheim , Calif. , put him in a neck hold while trying to arrest him . His family won a $ 13 million jury verdict . In 2017 , Hector Arreola died in Columbus , Ga. , after officers forced him to the ground , cuffed his hands behind him and leaned on his back , with one officer brushing off his complaints : `` He 's fine , '' he said . In 2018 , Cristobal Solano was arrested in Tustin , Calif. , and then died after at least seven deputies worked together to subdue him on the floor of a holding cell , some with their knees on his back . In 2019 , Vicente Villela died in an Albuquerque jail after telling guards who were holding him down with their knees that he could not breathe . `` Right , because they 're having to hold you down , '' one of the guards said . Then last week , the Police Department in Tucson , Ariz. , released video of an encounter on April 21 with Carlos Ingram Lopez , who was naked and behaving erratically when officers forced him to lie face down on the floor of a garage with his hands handcuffed behind his back . Part of the time , Mr. Lopez 's head was covered with a blanket and a hood . He was held down for 12 minutes , crying for air , for water and for his grandmother . Then he , too , died .", "seg_content_paragraph_starts": "0 95 161 165 232 292 342 472 527 604 673 732 781 804 842 889 930 976", "simhash": "f5a992680e896f42af37ff2d4e41df68", "spacy_content_loc": ["Montgomery County", "Dayton", "Ohio", "Milwaukee", "Coconut Creek", "Fla.", "Anaheim", "Calif.", "Columbus", "Ga.", "Tustin", "Calif.", "Albuquerque"], "spacy_content_num": ["one", "at least 70", "at least 70", "19", "65", "more than half", "Dozens", "$ 3.5 million", "nearly half", "one", "10", "$ 13 million", "one", "at least seven"], "spacy_content_org": ["the New York Times", "Times", "Times", "The Root", "Times"], "spacy_content_otr": [], "spacy_content_per": ["Eric Garner", "George Floyd", "Garner", "Floyd", "Robert Richardson", "Edward Flynn", "Derrick Scott", "Scott", "Javier Ambler", "Ambler", "Garner", "Floyd", "Ambler", "Scott", "Manuel Ellis", "Calvon Reid", "Fermin Vincent Valenzuela", "Hector Arreola", "Cristobal Solano", "Vicente Villela"], "spacy_content_tim": ["the last decade", "hours", "2018", "last year", "2012", "2014", "Earlier this month", "the last five years", "2015", "2016", "2017", "2018", "2019"], "spacy_title_loc": [], "spacy_title_num": ["at Least 70"], "spacy_title_org": [], "spacy_title_otr": [], "spacy_title_per": [], "spacy_title_tim": ["the Past Decade"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"CrimePublicsafety": 0.999980092048645}, "second_cat": {"CrimePublicsafety_Other": 0.999980092048645}}, "title_c_count": 24, "tpc_m": {"t543": 0.13077689707279205, "t113": 0.1453523337841034, "t101": 0.17855089902877808}, "url": "https://www.theroot.com/in-the-past-decade-at-least-70-people-have-died-in-pol-1844209308"}

'' Greg Gilbert has been farming in Tippecanoe County for 16 years . He never imagined he 'd be doing so during a pandemic . `` Your frame of mind is kind of changed , '' Gilbert explained . `` Your work environment . How you go about your work environment . '' That includes how to safely farm 4,000 acres of corn and soybeans . `` Each individual had a dedicated tractor , '' he said . `` If you could n't do a dedicated tractor , you 'd disinfect it real good before you utilized the equipment . '' COVID-19 has affected more than how Gilbert runs his business . He says a lower demand for corn has affected prices . `` We kind of saw cash corn prices there mid-March around $ 4 dollars declining to around $ 3 dollars now , '' Gilbert explained . Thirty-five to 40 percent of all corn produced in the United States goes to the ethanol industry . With Americans driving less due to quarantine , the need for ethanol is down , and it 's going to change the way farmers look at growing their business . `` There 's going to be less money available to perhaps rent that farm that 's next to you or less money available to purchase the land that 's next to you , '' Purdue Agricultural Economist Michael Langemeier explained . Langemeier said soybean profits are about the same as what was expected before the pandemic , but it may take a while for corn prices to come back up . `` If you have the low prices that 's going to perhaps reduce supply next year so the prices can improve next year and the year after , '' said Langemeier . That 's something Gilbert looks forward too . In the meantime , he 's focusing on keeping his staff healthy . `` Just operate with safety as your top priority and everybody goes home at night safe and sound , '' said Gilbert . Langemeier said COVID-19 is also impacting livestock , particularly pork . That 's due to an increase in production .

Ricardo `` Rick '' Rafael Torres , 50 , who now lives in South Carolina , received the sentence while participating in the hearing remotely via Zoom , which was held at the Bannock County Courthouse on June 24 . The June 24 hearing was held after the 10-year-old victim in the case and her parents were unable to log into Zoom and left out of Torres ' original sentencing hearing on May 5 . About two weeks later , 6th District Judge Steven A. Thomsen granted a new sentencing hearing and recused himself from the case . Sixth District Judge Scott E. Axline handed down Torres 's sentence last week after much discussion between Pocatello Prosecutor Ian Johnson and Torres ' Pocatello attorney , Stratton Laggis , about whether a letter that alleged prior deviant behavior on Torres ' part from his previous employer , the FBI , should be admissible for the judge to consider in determining the appropriate sentence . Pocatello police initially charged Torres in November 2019 with one count of misdemeanor sexual battery after he allegedly spanked the girl on Grace Lutheran Elementary School 's playground in September of that year . The victim 's mother said the playground incident occurred less than two weeks after Torres was advised by her as well as Grace Lutheran Elementary School officials not to touch her child after he allegedly placed the girl between his legs and started tickling her sides and armpits during a school-sponsored overnight camping trip to Camp Perkins in Stanley . Judge Axline ultimately denied a motion from Laggis during the hearing last week asking for the letter to be inadmissible and stricken from the record . The victim , her parents and Torres then made statements to the court before Axline handed down the sentence . The victim 's father described the experience as a nightmare . He said it was disgusting to hear from a Pocatello police officer that Torres was grooming his daughter , adding that Torres ' time at the FBI included investigating child sex crimes and that he should have known better than to repeatedly touch his daughter in ways that made her uncomfortable . `` This is how children get hurt and it 's just disgusting what we had to go through , '' the victim 's father said . `` I just want you to take the letter and the fact that he is supposed to be a professional and that he should know better than anyone else not to lay hands on children and pray you take it into consideration . '' The victim 's mother spoke largely about how her family and the Torres family were close prior to the incident , enjoying play dates , sleepovers and barbecues together before the unwanted touching of her daughter began . Moreover , she described the incident at Camp Perkins in more detail , of which she said the unwanted touching of her daughter occurred while the camp participants were playing a game . The game involved Torres acting as a wolf and involved campers catching him by forming a circle around him while holding hands . `` -LRB- Torres -RRB- took advantage of his place within Grace Lutheran 's community and that trust that was instilled in him as a teacher , '' the victim 's mother said . `` Furthermore , he took advantage of his background , garnering attention and trust from his reputation as a former FBI agent . He knew what he was doing and he knew that it was wrong . '' She continued , `` And how ironic that nine months ago Rick Torres played the wolf . We all know that the wolf in sheep 's clothing is most dangerous to the flock . '' The 10-year-old victim in the case provided a statement that began by saying she wanted to spend her fifth-grade year creating memories with her friends . She then detailed the fallout of being the reason Torres left the school and speaking out about Torres ' behavior . `` Because he made the decision to touch me even after he was told to stop , your honor , I hope that you will keep Rick Torres away from kids because no one should be made to feel that fearful or uncomfortable , '' she said . `` No other children should have to have an escape plan . No other children should feel judged for protecting themselves and standing up for what 's right . '' Torres first apologized for the unwanted touching of the victim , describing the incident as an inadvertent back-handed swat to fend off the victim 's kicking while she was lying on another student 's shoulders . `` It upset -LRB- the victim -RRB- and has her teacher , as a teacher period , I would never want to upset my students , '' Torres said . `` It was done of the words of the Grace Lutheran School 's internal investigation , ` in a playful manner while at recess , ' which is an accurate description . '' He explained he was unaware of the victims concerns following the Camp Perkins trip and said the 30 supporting character letters submitted on his behalf are more reflective of who is now than a letter from the FBI containing alleged behavior that happened seven or eight years ago . `` These letters talk about me as I am now , '' Torres said . `` I was a teacher trying to lead my students . '' In addition to the two years of record check probation , which include conditions Torres find employment in South Carolina and maintain a clean criminal record , Axline ordered and suspended 90 days in jail and imposed a fine of $ 750 . Axline also scheduled a review hearing for Torres ' case for June 15 , 2021 . `` If -LRB- the victim -RRB- felt uncomfortable , then she was uncomfortable , '' Axline said . `` The court has no problem with that at all . And the court does believe even if Mr. Torres did not have advance notice of the camp incident , he is in that position of responsibility as a teacher . '' The judge continued , `` It was your job , Mr. Torres , to know . It was your job to know that that was inappropriate in both instances . In the position you were in ... it does n't matter . You are a teacher and you should know .

PROVIDENCE , R.I. -LSB- Brown University -RSB- -- In a legal filing supporting Brown 's decision to revise its roster of varsity sports , the University is sharply rebutting claims against its strong commitment to female athletes and gender equity in athletics . Brown 's filing on Wednesday , Sept. 2 , in U.S. District Court in Rhode Island , asserts that plaintiffs seeking to overturn the University 's decision to change its varsity roster have resorted to baseless accusations and `` spurious conspiracy claims '' after Brown supplied clear data showing that it remains in full compliance with both Title IX and also a 1998 joint settlement agreement in the Cohen v. Brown case . The Joint Agreement , which specifies that the fraction of varsity athletics opportunities for women must be within a fixed percent of the fraction of women in the undergraduate student body , is being used to challenge changes in Brown 's varsity sports lineup . `` When they filed their Emergency Motion in June , Plaintiffs did not yet have access to the most recent roster Declaration Forms which unequivocally show that Brown will once again be in compliance with the Joint Agreement in the 2020-21 academic year , '' Brown states in its filing . `` It is perhaps unsurprising that since Plaintiffs came into possession of that data , they have resorted to spurious conspiracy claims and focused their energies on the process that led to Brown 's decision , rather than the hard data that makes Brown 's compliance with the Joint Agreement all but a certainty . '' The Joint Agreement , which settled a lawsuit filed by female athletes in the 1990s , established requirements at Brown for promoting equity in `` participation opportunities '' for women and men student-athletes . The agreement is separate from the federal Title IX Education Amendments of 1972 , the law prohibiting sex discrimination at federally funded institutions . The Joint Agreement imposes unique constraints on Brown 's athletics program that are not faced by any other college or university in the country , including the schools against which Brown 's teams compete . The plaintiffs in the case have filed a motion asking the court to overturn Brown 's decision to transition five women 's varsity sports and three men 's varsity sports to club status , and to add two new varsity teams that provide significant participation opportunities for women . Plaintiffs claim this decision violates the 1998 Joint Agreement and claims it 's a so-called plan to `` dismantle '' it . Brown 's legal filing in opposition to the plaintiffs ' motion argues that the plaintiffs have petitioned the court , not on a legal basis , but based on a false narrative that focuses on Brown 's acknowledged frustration with the unique constraints of the Joint Agreement . University President Christina H. Paxson , whose statements have appeared in recent filings , asserted that Brown 's concern over the restrictiveness of the Joint Agreement `` is entirely separate from our unwavering support for equal opportunity for women in athletics . '' `` Twenty-two years ago , Brown was clearly in violation of Title IX , and the Cohen agreement served an important purpose in creating opportunity for women athletes , but Brown 's engagement with issues of gender has changed , '' Paxson said . `` Since the original agreement , Brown has had three women presidents , our general counsel was a two-sport female varsity athlete at Brown , and we have one of the best records in varsity athletics among our peers for providing opportunities for woman student-athletes . '' Paxson continued , `` As someone who loves sports , routinely goes to the games and cheers these women athletes on , I have no intention on backsliding on our commitment to equity for women . It 's not only our legal obligation , it 's the right thing to do . '' Brown has complied fully with Title IX and the Joint Agreement , and has never implied anything other than a clear commitment to continue to do so , Paxson said . The varsity changes are part of the Excellence in Brown Athletics Initiative , which seeks to improve the competitiveness of Brown athletics . Before the initiative was announced in May , Brown had 38 varsity teams , the third-highest number in the country , without the resources to support a competitive experience for athletes on so many teams . Brown argues in its filing that the Cohen v. Brown Joint Agreement clearly permits improvements to its varsity program , including changing the composition of varsity teams : `` The Joint Agreement contemplates that Brown can and will adjust both its varsity sports teams and its roster sizes . All the provisions requiring that specific sports retain their varsity status expired after one to four years , in 2002 at the latest ... . '' Brown 's filing also argues strongly that compliance with the Joint Agreement rests solely on athletics rosters from the previous academic year , while the plaintiffs ask the court to see into the future to speculate about rosters in future years . Compliance `` turns on the number of varsity athletic participants on Brown 's athletics rosters on the first and last date of regular season competition -- neither of which has happened yet for the 2020-21 academic year , '' the filing states . Athletics Director Jack Hayes reiterated that Brown 's ongoing commitment to providing varsity athletics opportunities to women is based on its core values , and that wo n't change . `` When you compare the percentage of opportunities Brown provides for female varsity athletes with the percentage of female undergraduate students , which is one of the standards in higher education that Title IX sets for meeting equity requirements , Brown is a leader , '' Hayes said . `` The tactics being employed by the plaintiffs in this case have been shocking , '' he said . `` By making inferences and connections between unrelated statements , the plaintiffs in this case have built an absolutely false narrative about Brown 's commitment to diversity and gender equity , '' he said . Brown 's court filing presents extensive data in a series of tables to demonstrate that `` Plaintiffs provide no evidentiary basis for finding any violation . '' With the recent changes in its varsity program , the Joint Agreement requires that the percentage of women 's participation in sports and the percentage of undergraduate women enrolled at Brown vary by less than 2.25 % . For 2020-21 , putting aside disruptions in athletics due to COVID-19 , Brown expects this `` variance '' to be only 0.29 % . Not only is this expected variance within the established limit , it is roughly seven times less than what is required under the agreement . Also , Brown 's athletics rosters show an overall composition of 52 % women student-athletes and 48 % men student-athletes -- far exceeding participation numbers of women student-athletes at peer institutions and across the nation . Brown 's filing asserts : `` This is not a proceeding about whether Brown would prefer to be governed only by Title IX , rather than navigate the dual and different requirements of Title IX and the Joint Agreement . Brown officials are entitled to their subjective views on the Joint Agreement , even while they are committed to complying with it . Nor is this a proceeding about whether Brown followed Plaintiffs ' preferred process in deciding to transition certain varsity sports to club status . ... `` This is a proceeding about a single provision in the Joint Agreement -- specifically , whether Brown unequivocally intends to commit a gross violation of the gender proportionality requirement for the 2020-21 academic year . Brown 's witnesses all stated that Brown intends to abide by the Joint Agreement , and the best roster information available demonstrates that it will in fact do so .

The motion claims that when the University demoted eight varsity sports to the club level , it had a `` disproportionate impact on women 's representation in the Brown athletics that runs afoul of the maximum gender disparity allowed under the original agreement , '' according to a press release from the American Civil Liberties Union of Rhode Island . `` The plaintiff in this case is taking the unusual step of asking Brown to see into the future to provide data on rosters for the upcoming year , and is doing this at a time when a pandemic has created tremendous and unprecedented uncertainty around college enrollments and the status of athletic competition for the fall season , '' University Spokesperson Brian Clark wrote in an email to The Herald . `` Today 's motion is a preemptive legal action asserting a hypothetical violation that has not taken place -- and Brown would not allow this speculative scenario to emerge in future athletic seasons , '' Clark wrote . `` Brown 's commitment to gender equity in athletics is clear . On May 28 , the University announced that it would cut men and women 's fencing , men and women 's golf , women 's skiing , men and women 's squash , women 's equestrian and men 's track , field and cross country from the varsity roster . Following widespread criticism from the University community , President Christina Paxson P ’19 announced that the University would reinstate only men 's track , field and cross country . In her initial defense of cutting these three teams in particular , Paxson argued that doing so would ensure Title IX compliance according to requirements stipulated by Cohen v. Brown University -LRB- 1998 -RRB- . The University must maintain a percentage of women athletes closely proportional to the women student population . Track , field and cross country were the largest men 's teams , second only to football , a team the University must maintain in order to retain membership in the Ivy League . The University 's `` decision to eliminate five women 's intercollegiate athletic varsity teams , and with them meaningful participation opportunities for women , constitutes a gross and willful violation of the Joint Agreement to the immediate and irreparable harm of the class , '' wrote the motion to enforce judgement . According to the court filing , the University failed to provide `` requested production of reports , resolutions and analyses of the decision-making leading up to the determination to cut the five women 's teams and that only by cutting men 's track , field and -LRB- cross country -RRB- would Brown comply with the Settlement Agreement . '' While Paxson pointed to the addition of roster spots for female athletes on the co-ed sailing team , which was afforded varsity status when the other eight teams were demoted , the plaintiffs argue that their calculations of proportional opportunities for women used by the University rely on the percentage of women undergraduates from the 2019-20 academic year -- 52.3 percent . The University claims that projections for enrollment for the 2020-21 academic year were unavailable , according to the filing . `` Based on the numbers provided by Brown , if the five women 's teams were eliminated along with the six men 's teams originally included -LRB- including track , field and cross country -RRB- , then women 's opportunities would be -LRB- depending on the year -RRB- 42.15 percent or 42.72 percent of the total eliminated -- bringing women closer to equality in Brown 's program , '' according to the court filing . `` But with men 's track , field and cross country reinstated and no other changes made , women 's opportunities will be -LRB- depending on the year -RRB- 66.83 percent or 69.35 percent of the total eliminated -- bringing women farther from equality in Brown 's program .

The soon-to-be junior at Michigan State University hung out with friends late June 20 , after those same friends had been to Harper 's Restaurant and Brewpub earlier that night . So far , at least 85 people have tested positive for the potentially deadly coronavirus after patronizing Harper 's , near the MSU campus , from June 12 to June 20 . Social media posts from the bar show that few in the college-age crowd were wearing masks . `` -LSB- I -RSB- got exposed to them and one of the girls that actually worked at Harper 's , '' Mancini said . `` Once I figured it out , I 'm like , ` I definitely either have -LSB- the virus -RSB- or I 'm just really , really lucky . ''' The latest : Michigan coronavirus unemployment , map , curve , updated COVID-19 news Dashboard : Michigan coronavirus testing numbers , trends , COVID-19 data He and his friends were lucky -- none tested positive for the virus , Mancini told Bridge . But even with a college bar-sparked outbreak so large that it has made national headlines , the student said he doubts his peers will be more careful in the future . `` When people come back on campus , there 's going to be FOMO -LRB- Fear of Missing Out -RRB- , '' said Mancini , who lives in the Oakland County suburb of Berkley . `` I 'm going to be wanting to hang out with people and stuff . `` -LSB- But -RSB- I think overall my mentality is going to be in the back of my head : ` Do I really want to get coronavirus ? ''' That 's a question that 's top of mind for colleges and universities across Michigan as they develop plans to bring students back to campuses for the fall semester amid a global pandemic . Schools are taking unprecedented precautions , from moving many classes online to , on some campuses , requiring masks . But the Harper 's super-spreader incident , and interviews with students enrolled in Michigan colleges , provide a sobering reality check . COVID-19 may have sickened 63,000 Michigan residents and killed nearly 6,000 in four months , but for some college students , contracting coronavirus is a risk they 're willing to take to socialize with friends . `` I think -LSB- my parents -RSB- are a lot more concerned than I am , '' said Mikaeyla Connolly , a rising junior at Oakland University . `` I 'm not as concerned , definitely in part due to my age . '' Colleges and university campuses across the country closed in mid-March to try to stem the spread of COVID-19 , switching to remote learning for the remainder of the semester . Most public and private universities in Michigan have announced plans for the fall that bring students back to campuses , but with stringent health precautions . Oakland University , for example , will hold most of its classes online and use auditoriums and ballrooms for face-to-face classes to allow social-distancing . Central Michigan and Eastern Michigan are dusting off unused dormitories for single-person rooms . Some campuses will require masks on campus , including the University of Michigan-Dearborn . Michigan State University announced Friday that face coverings will be required for everyone who ventures on to campus this fall , both indoors and outdoors . Young adults tend to not be as severely affected by COVID-19 as their parents and grandparents , with many having minor or no symptoms at all . But those young adults can spread the virus to more susceptible people , from family members at Thanksgiving break to professors during office hours . The safety of students , staff and faculty are a priority for university administrators . Take Northern Michigan University as an example where President Fritz Erickson said in a statement , `` We will take all reasonable measures necessary to make classes , housing , dining , student events and all university activities safe . '' But universities have little control over what happens when students step out of class . Isabella Panse , a rising junior at the University of Michigan , is n't sure that any regulation by her university will make that big of a difference . `` I 'm excited to go back , but ... I think that once everyone goes back , it 's unlikely that people will follow up all social distancing and be responsible . '' Yixin Xiao , a rising senior at the University of Michigan , told Bridge , `` I 'm not super worried about returning to the fall ... because even if I do get -LSB- COVID-19 -RSB- , I 'm certain I 'll be fine , and I think most people will be fine . `` Susan Dynarski , professor of education , public policy and economics at the University of Michigan , imagines a nightmare scenario of a Harper 's super-spreader event every weekend in college towns across America . `` Here 's a scarily plausible chain of events . Colleges bring students back to campus -- where they act like college students , '' Dynarksi wrote in an opinion piece in the New York Times . `` They meet over coffee , go to parties and bars , pair off on dates and congregate in crowded dorms . The virus quickly spreads among students , who mostly recover quickly or are entirely asymptomatic . '' `` But soon the virus reaches the older , more vulnerable members of the faculty and staff , as well as local residents . Infections surge . '' Masks are a proven tool to curb the spread of the coronavirus and Michian State University plans on penalizing those who do n't comply . That 's not an idea that goes over well with students who spoke to Bridge . `` I do n't think that you should really ask college students , who are stressed in their own ways about getting a job or getting through their classes to -LSB- wear masks at parties -RSB- , '' said Sarah Shetty , a rising junior in economics at U-M . `` It 's up to an individual to decide whether they 're going to protect themselves , or if they 're just going to think they can get over the coronavirus if they get it . '' Peer pressure is what leads Laurence Steinberg , a professor of psychology at Temple University in Philadelphia , to be pessimistic that campuses will be able to control the spread of coronavirus . `` My pessimistic prediction is that the college and university reopening strategies under consideration will work for a few weeks before their effectiveness fizzles out , '' Steinberg wrote in the New York Times . `` By then , many students will have become cavalier about wearing masks and sanitizing their hands . '' Colin Pufahl , a sophomore at Central Michigan University , said he is n't worried about contracting the coronavirus on the Mt. Pleasant campus . `` I think that most students are itching to go back and see their friends again , '' Pufahl said . `` I 'm really not concerned at all about getting COVID . My main concern would be transferring it to my family on a trip home or something like that . '' Staying home rather than returning to campus is n't a financial option for some students . Many U-M students in Ann Arbor signed leases for the upcoming school year before the pandemic , committing to pay thousands of dollars for apartments near a campus on which they may take few , if any , classes this fall . U-M senior Xiao also feels trapped by the housing situation in Ann Arbor . `` We 'll only be back for three months and there 's a chance that afterward we wo n't be back at all , and I do n't see the point in coming back for those first three months ... I just signed a nine-month lease for my house , and I 'm only going to be there for three of the nine months . I 'm just like ` Should I even sign the lease at all ? ''' Others , particularly incoming freshmen interviewed by Bridge , remain excited and trust universities to implement proper policies and make decisions based on preserving the health of their students and faculty . Rebecca Dick , an incoming freshman at Wayne State University -- where they have not announced plans yet -- said she believes the university `` is not going to allow kids back on campus if they feel that they ca n't enforce -LSB- health regulations -RSB- or if they feel that it 's an unsafe environment for them to do so . '' Evelynne Crumm , an incoming freshman studying finance at U-M , agrees . `` I think there 's always going to be some sort of underlying fear , but I personally am not overtly fearful or super-concerned about this , '' Crumm said . `` I feel like there 's going to be strong enough policies in place and people will wear masks . '' Still , Harper 's Bar remains an example of what could be a common headline on campuses this fall . For MSU junior Celeste Sullivan , the massive number of infections from one bar was a warning . `` Knowing that something like that happened so close to campus recently , it 's super important to be out and be careful , '' she said . Alyssa Moore , a rising junior at U-M agrees , `` There 's a lot of people who are n't being very cautious right now and are going out with their friends and like that sort of thing , '' Moore said . `` So I think that the university atmosphere does make it hard for a lot of people to actually take those precautions because they do n't seem to think that it 's necessary .

Supervisors Mark Ridley-Thomas and Sheila Kuehl recommended the new office as a way to centralize worker protection initiatives . It would be charged with promoting and enforcing county labor laws on minimum wages , for example , handling disputes and leading policy research and development with a focus on racial , health and economic equity . `` As we discuss the impact of COVID-19 on the health and financial well-being of our residents , it seems more important than ever to further explore how we can better support our workforce , '' Ridley-Thomas said . `` This pandemic is dynamic -- and has pushed us to be dynamic in our response , specifically to support our workforce , many of whom are providing essential services and keeping our economy afloat . '' While Californians have filed more than 7.1 million unemployment claims since March , Los Angeles County has reported unemployment rates of roughly 20 % over the past few months , according to the motion . A July 2020 study by the California Employment Development Department Labor Market Information Division indicated that workplace transmissions account for almost half of COVID-19 cases statewide and Latino and Black workers are disproportionately hard-hit . `` It 's even more difficult these days to be a low-wage essential worker , '' Kuehl said . `` You are barely able to make it financially and to make it even worse , your employer has made clear they will not enforce COVID-19 public health guidelines . Your dilemma : should you risk your job or your life ? That 's why we want to make sure that employees can report violations of our county health orders and feel confident they will not face retaliation from their employer . '' The supervisors said investing in vulnerable workers makes economic sense , pointing to studies by the Brookings Institute and Harvard Business Review showing that strong worker protections decrease turnover and increase productivity , preserve employer-employee relations , and attract economically complex industries that accelerate regional economic growth . Supervisor Kathryn Barger said she liked the idea of streamlining county systems , but was concerned about setting up new offices at a time when the county is struggling financially . She asked for an analysis of costs to be included in a report back . `` I think hiring new staff to duplicate economic research that exists in the private and public is not the best use of our limited resources at this time , '' Barger said . `` I do support the attempts -LRB- toward -RRB- savings costs and reducing duplication of work . '' The board directed staffers to report back in 60 days on how the county can improve and centralize its efforts related to worker protections . L.A.

The ordinance , titled `` Back to Work '' emergency ordinance , requires that as certain employers reopen , they must first seek to rehire the employee who previously held the position or a similar position before offering the position to another individual . This ordinance takes effect upon signature of the Mayor and will remain in effect for 60 days unless the Board of Supervisors votes to extend its application . This new emergency ordinance applies to for-profit and non-profit employers that directly or indirectly own or operate a business in the City or County of San Francisco and employ , or have employed , 100 or more employees on or after February 25 , 2020 . The only employers exempted from the new ordinance are government entities and certain healthcare operations as defined under the Health Officer 's Order . Employees are covered by the ordinance if they were employed for at least 90 days of the calendar year preceding a covered layoff . Covered layoffs are limited to any layoff of 10 or more employees in any 30 day period starting on February 25 , 2020 , until the expiration of the ordinance , and was caused by the employer 's lack of funds or lack of work due to the COVID-19 public health emergency declared by both the mayor of San Francisco and the governor of California . Employers covered by the `` Back to Work '' emergency ordinance have the following obligations : Employers must provide eligible employees with written notice of a covered layoff and the right to reemployment , at or before the time the layoff becomes effective . If a covered layoff has already occurred , the employer has 30 days from the effective date of the ordinance to provide written notice to eligible employees . As employers reopen , they must first seek to rehire the employee who previously held the position , or a substantially similar position , before offering the position to another individual . Such offers of reemployment must be made in order of seniority if more than one eligible worker could be rehired for the same position . An employer is permitted to withhold an offer of rehire if after layoff it was discovered the employee engaged in any act of dishonesty , violation of the law , violation of policy , or rule of the employer . An employer may also withhold an offer of rehire if the employee executed a severance agreement at the time of layoff . Employers must also notify the Office of Economic Workforce Development in writing of all covered layoffs and offers of reemployment made under the ordinance , as well as all acceptances and rejections of rehire offers by eligible employees . Employers that implement covered layoffs must retain the following records for at least two years : eligible employee 's full legal name , job classification at the time of separation , date of hire , last known address , last known email address , last known telephone number and a copy of the lay off notice provided . The ordinance prohibits employers from discriminating against an eligible employee who is experiencing a `` Family Care Hardship '' , which includes needing to care for a child due to school closures or lack of available childcare , or any grounds for which a person may use paid sick leave to care for another . Eligible employees are entitled to reasonable accommodation of job duty or job requirements if a Family Care Hardship impacts their ability to perform a job duty or to satisfy a job requirement . Employers must make a good faith effort to reasonably accommodate an eligible employee . This duty to accommodate expires with the expiration of the ordinance .", "seg_content_paragraph_starts": "0 105 175 265 281 337 456 495 553", "simhash": "e77fff6eaa41408e36be926e7789bc5f", "spacy_content_loc": ["the City or County of San Francisco", "San Francisco", "California"], "spacy_content_num": ["first", "100", "10", "first", "more than one"], "spacy_content_org": ["the San Francisco Board of Supervisors", "the Board of Supervisors", "the Health Officer 's Order", "the Office of Economic Workforce Development"], "spacy_content_otr": ["`` Back to Work '' emergency ordinance , requires that as certain employers reopen , they must", "` Family Care Hardship ''", "a Family Care Hardship"], "spacy_content_per": [], "spacy_content_tim": ["June 23 , 2020", "60 days", "February 25 , 2020", "at least 90 days", "the calendar year", "30 day", "February 25 , 2020", "30 days", "at least two years"], "spacy_title_loc": ["San Francisco Passes Reemployment Ordinance"], "spacy_title_num": [], "spacy_title_org": [], "spacy_title_otr": [], "spacy_title_per": [], "spacy_title_tim": [], "text_category": {}, "title_c_count": 5, "tpc_m": {"t385": 0.14918670058250427, "t179": 0.1311883181333542, "t31": 0.16347149014472961}, "url": "https://www.natlawreview.com/article/san-francisco-passes-reemployment-ordinance"}

The document , sent Monday to Congressional leaders , was signed by leaders of the Motion Picture Association , the Directors Guild of America , the Independent Film & Television Alliance , the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees and SAG-AFTRA . `` We believe a hiring incentive modeled on the employee retention credit or the work opportunity tax credit -LRB- WOTC -RRB- will help move workers off of unemployment and bring them back into the workforce , '' the letter said . `` The employee retention credit enacted as part of the CARES Act and the longstanding WOTC provide models that can be revised to accomplish this goal . For example , after Hurricane Katrina , Congress temporarily expanded WOTC eligible groups to include a ` Hurricane Katrina employee . ' '' The missive noted that there 's only a minimal amount of production underway due to the COVID-19 pandemic -- partly due to the lack of available insurance . `` The ability of our industry to return to active production , whether on set or on location , is severely compromised by the inability to purchase insurance to cover losses stemming from communicable diseases amongst cast , crew and others involved in the production , '' the letter said . `` This insurance has been available in the past and is essential to the decisions by banks and others to risk investment in a film or program that may be shut down while a single member of the cast recovers from illness or as a result of civil authority order , unrelated to the specific production . Without it , production -- especially independent production -- can not resume on a significant level .

The caffeine and acidity levels have a bad reputation for causing tummy troubles -- but do n't toss your grounds out just yet ! It turns out , you can still enjoy your morning java and even use it to give your microbiome a boost with a few surprising add-ins . Will Bulsiewicz , MD , a gastroenterologist and author of Fiber Fueled -LRB- $ 25.65 , Amazon -RRB- , recently shared his gut healthy coffee tips on Instagram . `` Coffee itself is n't the problem , '' he explains . `` But rather , it 's the garbage we add to it . Artificial sweeteners , dairy milk , sugar on sugar , syrups , more sugar -- the list goes on and on . '' Instead of those `` garbage '' additions , Dr. Bulsiewicz recommends opting for a few spices : cinnamon , ginger , and turmeric . Cinnamon probably does n't sound too crazy -- it 's one of the usual sprinkle options often found on coffee shop counters . It also acts as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory ingredient that can help keep your blood sugar balanced on top of benefiting your microbiome . Ginger and turmeric , on the other hand , might be more surprising suggestions . However , they both pack potent anti-inflammatory perks that can help keep our gut happy -LRB- and maybe even lose a little weight -RRB- . Turmeric also has a slightly sweet flavor that can help when going without sugar or artificial sweeteners . Bulsiewicz does n't list specific recommended amounts of the spices per coffee cup , but we gave it a try with a few pinches of each . Even as someone who usually hates cinnamon , I was pleasantly surprised by how nice they all tasted together in my morning coffee ! I used ground ginger , but I 'm sure grating fresh from a root would also work . And it is definitely the strongest flavor of the three , but the turmeric balanced it out -- and both helped hide the cinnamon well enough that I did n't even notice it while letting each one provide their health perks . For those who are reluctant to go completely without more traditional add-ins , Bulsiewicz recommends simply swapping them out with healthier natural alternatives , like stevia or monkfruit for sweetness , or soy or oat milk rather than dairy . And do n't forget to stay hydrated with plenty of water , too !

It tastes really nice , but it has been linked to tooth decay , obesity , diabetes , heart disease , accelerated aging and many other maladies . But for those who ca n't imagine their morning cup of coffee without a little sugar , it can be a hard habit to kick . For decades , food scientists have been developing alternatives to sugar , known as artificial sweeteners . Most of these sugar substitutes are produced chemically but are generally safe for consumption . In the USA , the FDA has approved the following compounds as artificial sweeteners : Aspartame Acesulfame potassium -LRB- Generally used in combination with other sweeteners -RRB- Neotame -LRB- Used primarily in diet foods and drinks -RRB- Saccharin Sucralose Stevia Monk fruit extract Advantame -LRB- Not commonly used at this time -RRB- These artificial sweeteners might be considered safe to consume , but are they necessarily healthy ? Most artificial sweeteners are highly concentrated , meaning you need to use less to provide a similar sweet taste to sugar . This combined with the fact that they do n't cause a spike in blood sugar levels makes them an attractive prospect to many people with dietary restrictions . However , some research indicates that these sugar substitutes may cause an increase in appetite , resulting in weight gain for the user . Some artificial sweeteners may also negatively impact digestive health , causing unpleasant side effects like gas and diarrhea . With that said , there is a scale of artificial sweeteners , so below we 'll break down the best and the world sweeteners for your health . The Worst Artificial Sweeteners Let 's start by discussing the worst artificial sweeteners for your health . While sold as zero sugar and often zero calories , these sweeteners are full of chemicals that wo n't do your body any favors . 1 . Aspartame WORST SIDE EFFECTS Although you 'll see aspartame in many artificial sweeteners , including Equal , it 's actually linked to a slew of side effects , including headache , nausea and fatigue on the mild end of the spectrum . It may also cause more serious health impacts , like seizures , heart palpitations and anxiety attacks . However , on the other side of things , some studies indicate that the negative effects may be overstated . Scientists continue to study Aspartame , but until conclusive research is released , it may be best to avoid its consumption . 2 . Sucralose MOST POPULAR First introduced and certified by the FDA in 1999 , Sucralose -LRB- sold as Splenda -RRB- has become one of the most popular artificial sweeteners in the United States . This sugar substitute is actually made from sugar itself . By using a chemical process , sucralose becomes 400 to 700 times sweeter than sugar , meaning you need less of it in a cup of coffee to achieve the same effect . However , sucralose has been linked to an increase in blood glucose levels and a decrease of healthy bacteria in the GI tract . In addition , sucralose should not be used in baking as it may release harmful chemical compounds when heated . 3 . Saccharin FIRST ARTIFICIAL SWEETENER Known as the first chemically produced artificial sweetener , saccharin has been sold for decades as Sweet ` N Low . It 's also a popular ingredient in diet sodas , juices , chewing gum and even some toothpaste . Today , most governments around the world consider saccharin to be safe for consumption ; however , a few studies done on rats have linked the sweetener to bladder cancer . More recent studies have shown that it can throw off the balance of bacteria in the gut . Although it might not be as harmful as aspartame , more research needs to be done on this particular artificial sweetener . 4 . Xylitol BEST SUGAR ALCOHOL Both xylitol and erythritol -LRB- number five -RRB- are considered sugar alcohols . This means they are created by combining a sugar molecule with an alcohol molecule , creating a new substance entirely . The body does n't absorb sugar alcohol in the same way it digests sugar . Therefore , diabetics have found the use of xylitol to be helpful in maintaining consistent blood sugar levels . On the other hand , it should be noted that xylitol taken in large doses can cause diarrhea and gas . 5 . Erythritol BEST OF THE WORST Reading the package of erythritol sold by NOW Foods , you would think it 's a wonder food sent to solve your sugar woes . And while it does have a very low glycemic impact and zero calories , it 's still a sugar alcohol just like xylitol and shares many of the same side effects . In particular , erythritol is fermented by the bacteria in the stomach causing bloating and gas . With that said , there does n't appear to be any serious side effects of consuming minimal amounts of erythritol in your diet . The Best Artificial Sweeteners Although the best kind of sugar is no sugar at all , the five artificial sweeteners listed below make a decent substitute for real sugar . 6 . Stevia BEST FOR HOT DRINKS Stevia is a sweet substance extracted from the Stevia rebaudiana plant which is native to South America . For centuries , people have been using the leaves of this plant to sweeten foods and drinks , but the FDA has only approved a highly refined form of stevia due to concerns around its consumption in the raw . The result of the government-approved processes is a substance called steviol glycoside which is 200 to 400 times sweeter than sugar . Today , stevia is available for purchase in a variety of forms and can be used in everything from hot drinks to baked goods . 7 . Monk Fruit Extract BEST FOR SMOOTHIES Native to Southeast Asia , the monk fruit has been dried and used in herbal medicines for centuries . However , this substance actually contains mogrosides , which are 150 to 200 times sweeter than sugar . The FDA has approved dried monk fruit to be used as a tabletop sweetener in smoothies or hot drinks . The best part is that monk fruit extract contains zero calories , zero carbohydrates and zero sugars . It 's also a source of antioxidants . However , monk fruit is generally more expensive than other sweeteners , and some people may find that it has an unpleasant aftertaste . 8 . Coconut Sugar BEST FOR BAKED GOODS It 's important to note that the last three `` artificial '' sweeteners on our list are in fact real sugars . They do contain glucose , sucrose and fructose , and therefore your body will digest them in the same way it consumes sugar . However , they do not contain as much fructose as refined sugar , and they also provide trace amounts of other nutrients as well . Coconut sugar , in particular , has become increasingly popular in recent years due to the fact it 's a very natural product . Plus , it forms a one-to-one substitute for granulated sugar , making it easy to use in recipes for baked goods . 9 . Yacon Syrup NEWEST SUGAR SUBSTITUTE Recently , Yacon syrup has been gaining a lot of positive press thanks to several celebrities touting its effectiveness , including Daphne Oz . The syrup is extracted from the yacon , a potato-like vegetable grown in the Andes Mountains of South America . Unlike many artificial sweeteners that throw off the delicate balance of bacteria in the gut , yacon is actually a prebiotic and high in fiber , so it helps to feed to beneficial bacteria in the digestive tract . However , some users say that yacon syrup can cause stomach upset . Therefore , it 's best to limit first time consumption to one to two teaspoons . 10 . Agave Syrup BEST OF THE BEST In the past five years or so , agave syrup has become one of the most popular alternatives to sugar . The syrup is produced from the juice of the agave plant , a type of cactus that 's native to Mexico . Because agave has a smaller amount of glucose than table sugar , it does not cause a spike in blood sugar levels , which makes it a better choice for individuals with diabetes . On the other hand , it does still contain high levels of fructose and may , therefore , cause liver damage if used excessively over time . With that said , agave syrup is a wholesome alternative to sugar . Just make sure to buy and use high quality , organic agave , like this Agave In The Raw Sweetener .", "seg_content_paragraph_starts": "0 64 111 112 123 133 134 135 136 139 148 164 214 257 285 289 327 330 333 431 434 436 553 556 559 670 673 676 765 768 772 870 874 900 903 907 1012 1017 1020 1127 1131 1135 1252 1256 1259 1371 1375 1379", "simhash": "304d4be395d4bcb7588e5d021b4c5672", "spacy_content_loc": ["USA", "the United States"], "spacy_content_num": ["as zero", "zero", "1", "2", "First", "400", "700", "3", "FIRST", "first", "4", "five", "5", "zero", "five", "6"], "spacy_content_org": ["FDA", "The Worst Artificial Sweeteners Let 's", "Equal", "FDA", "Splenda", "Sweet ` N Low", "NOW Foods", "The Best Artificial Sweeteners"], "spacy_content_otr": [], "spacy_content_per": [], "spacy_content_tim": ["morning", "decades", "1999", "decades", "Today"], "spacy_title_loc": [], "spacy_title_num": [], "spacy_title_org": [], "spacy_title_otr": [], "spacy_title_per": [], "spacy_title_tim": [], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"Health": 0.9966012239456177, "Lifestyle": 1.0000100135803223}, "second_cat": {"Lifestyle_FoodDrink": 1.0000100135803223, "Health_Nutrition": 0.9966012239456177}}, "title_c_count": 11, "tpc_m": {"t137": 0.11675740033388138, "t13": 0.3131610155105591}, "url": "https://spy.com/articles/health-wellness/diet-nutrition/best-artificial-sweetener-268026/"}

On March 11th , 2020 , the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS‐CoV‐2 to be a global pandemic . Governments around the world urged people to follow preventive health measures such as frequent hand washing and physical distancing . `` It is noticeable that compliance with containment measures varies greatly between people , '' said the authors of the new study . `` This is at least partially connected with psychological factors such as personality traits . '' `` To our knowledge , this is the first study focused on COVID-19 compliance with the containment measures and antisocial traits to be conducted in a large Latin American sample using a repeated cross-sectional design . '' In the online study , 1,578 Brazilian adults completed a measure of maladaptive personality traits between May 21 and June 29 , 2020 . They also completed assessments of empathy and compliance with COVID-19 containment measures . The researchers found that those who scored higher on measures of callousness , deceitfulness , hostility , impulsivity , manipulativeness , and risk-taking tended to be less compliant with COVID-19 containment measures , such as socially distancing , washing hands frequently , and wearing a facemask in public . Participants with greater empathy , on the other hand , tended to be more compliant with COVID-19 containment measures . `` Our findings indicated that antisocial traits , especially lower levels of empathy and higher levels of Callousness and Risk-taking , are directly associated with compliance with containment measures . These traits explain , at least partially , the reason why people continue not adhering to the containment measures even with the increasing numbers of cases and deaths , '' the researchers said . `` Exposing oneself and others to risk , even when it can be avoided , is a typical trait for people with antisocial tendencies , and with low levels of empathy . '' The new findings are in line with previous research conducted in the United States and Poland , which also found that antisocial personality traits were associated with ignoring preventative measures meant to halt the spread of COVID-19 . `` Our findings can be useful for public health policies , e.g. , through screenings that demonstrate an elevation in these traits , interventions can be carried out aiming at greater awareness and consequent compliance with containment measures . We suggest that further studies be carried out investigating the interaction of these traits with other variables , '' said the authors of the new research . The study , `` Compliance with containment measures to the COVID-19 pandemic over time : Do antisocial traits matter ? `` , was authored by Fabiano Koich Miguel , Gisele Magarotto Machado , Giselle Pianowski , and Lucasde Francisco Carvalho . -LRB- Image by Engin Akyurt from Pixabay -RRB-", "seg_content_paragraph_starts": "0 52 96 135 172 209 278 342 375 413 479 520", "simhash": "fc0e2396f671222518adaa697df4c8db", "spacy_content_loc": ["Brazil", "the United States", "Poland", "Giselle Pianowski"], "spacy_content_num": ["first", "1,578"], "spacy_content_org": ["the World Health Organization", "Latin American", "Brazilian", "Callousness"], "spacy_content_otr": ["Personality and Individual Differences"], "spacy_content_per": ["Fabiano Koich Miguel", "Gisele Magarotto Machado", "Lucasde Francisco Carvalho", "Engin Akyurt", "Pixabay"], "spacy_content_tim": ["March 11th , 2020", "between May 21 and June 29 , 2020"], "spacy_title_loc": [], "spacy_title_num": [], "spacy_title_org": [], "spacy_title_otr": [], "spacy_title_per": [], "spacy_title_tim": [], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"Health": 0.837593138217926, "Society": 0.9999967813491821, "CrimePublicsafety": 0.9996463060379028}, "second_cat": {"Society_Other": 0.9999967813491821, "Health_Other": 0.837593138217926, "CrimePublicsafety_Other": 0.9996463060379028}}, "title_c_count": 15, "tpc_m": {"t724": 0.3257131278514862, "t646": 0.12991154193878174, "t770": 0.11448625475168228}, "url": "https://www.psypost.org/2020/08/sociopathic-traits-linked-to-non-compliance-with-mask-guidelines-and-other-covid-19-containment-measures-57773"}	{"_id": "0PTOifwo", "c_word": 375, "channels": ["Men^^Health", "Health^^Care", "Public^^Health", "Health^^Data", "Healthy^^People"], "countries": "", "date": "2020-06-29 14:21:00", "domain": "ifiberonenewsradio.com", "epoch": {"$numberLong": "1593440460"}, "geotag": [{"name": "seattle", "score": 0.9706733822822571, "coord": "47.606209,-122.332071", "pid": "seattle,washington", "type": "city"}], "highlightkeyword_list": [["Scott^^Itano", 0.3002207638629326], ["SEATTLE", 6.913710496260085E-6], ["Washington", 1.4815875438331109E-6], ["Health", 1.0633088071510803E-6]], "kw_title": ["Health^^data", "Men", "Department^^of^^Health"], "kws": ["women", "Health^^data", "toxic^^masculinity", "Men", "care", "people", "Department^^of^^Health", "complications", "deaths", "COVID-19-related^^deaths", "Family^^medicine", "proper^^precautions", "manliness", "check-ups", "public", "face^^masks", "weakness", "face", "online^^profiles", "show^^signs"], "ne_content_location": {"U.S.": 1, "U.K.": 1, "Washington": 1, "SEATTLE": 1}, "ne_content_organization": {"Kaiser Permanente Washington": 1, "Washington State Department of Health": 1}, "ne_content_person": {"Scott Itano": 1, "Itano": 6}, "paragraph_count": 11.0, "predicate_content": ["SEATTLE", "believe", "finds", "says", "says", "`", "think", "come", "been", "required", "risk", "says", "says", "says", "suggests", "says", "have", "adds", "thanks"], "predicate_title": ["Men"], "seg_content": "SEATTLE - Many men believe they 're less vulnerable to COVID-19 , and that has consequences for how safe they really are during the pandemic . A new survey conducted in the U.S. and U.K. finds women are more likely to wear face masks than men . Family medicine physician Dr. Scott Itano with Kaiser Permanente Washington says the issue is what he calls `` toxic masculinity '' - viewing manliness through a traditional lens in which men have to be brave and self-reliant at all times . `` They 're less likely to be vulnerable or show signs of weakness , '' says Itano . `` And I think wearing masks and seeking care from a doctor , to them , feels like showing a sign of weakness or being vulnerable . '' Unfortunately , he says , this mind-set could come at a high cost . According to Washington State Department of Health data , 54 % of COVID-19-related deaths have been men . Starting today , face masks are required in public in Washington . Itano says people do n't just put themselves at risk when they do n't follow proper precautions to avoid novel coronavirus exposure - they risk other people 's lives , too . `` Even though a person might be a young , healthy 35-year-old man , , '' says Itano , `` he could have grandparents or loved ones , or friends who are immunocompromised or at high risk for complications . '' Itano says men 's COVID-19 attitudes extend to how they manage their health in other ways . He says it 's often difficult to get men to come in for check-ups . He suggests they seek out the right doctor for them . `` Ask your buddies who they go to for their medical care and check bios online , '' says Itano . `` Most systems and doctors have online profiles , where you can read about them and find someone you think you might get along with . '' He adds it is n't helpful to be confrontational about COVID-19 or self-care in general . Itano usually thanks his male patients for making the effort to come in and see him .", "seg_content_paragraph_starts": "0 26 88 134 166 178 210 251 283 294 342", "simhash": "e02c23a7125362b15408f2ff2719f87b", "spacy_content_loc": ["U.S.", "U.K.", "Washington"], "spacy_content_num": ["54 %"], "spacy_content_org": ["Kaiser Permanente Washington", "Itano", "Washington State Department of Health", "Itano", "Itano", "Itano"], "spacy_content_otr": [], "spacy_content_per": ["Scott Itano", "Itano", "Itano"], "spacy_content_tim": ["today"], "spacy_title_loc": [], "spacy_title_num": [], "spacy_title_org": [], "spacy_title_otr": [], "spacy_title_per": [], "spacy_title_tim": [], "text_category": {}, "title_c_count": 10, "tpc_m": {"t577": 0.10822682082653046, "t844": 0.15018363296985626, "t662": 0.1131761223077774}, "url": "http://www.ifiberonenewsradio.com/news/local_news/men-at-greater-covid-19-risk-because-of-attitudes-toward-health/article_c52c2c5a-ba13-11ea-b3a4-83d1232e22f2.html"}

To my fellow Reading residents : I hope you will join me on or before September 1st in voting against the recall of my friend and Select Board colleague , Vanessa Alvarado . I could not be more firmly opposed to the recall . This recall effort is the most dismaying manifestation of the polarization and too-often toxic nature of our local politics . The effort to recall Vanessa is spearheaded by John Arena , a former member of the Board she defeated in a regular local election in 2018 . I watched in shock and chagrin -LRB- to put it mildly -RRB- as a narrative was created in February to justify this recall effort . But the effort is , viewed most charitably , designed to express disagreement with Vanessa 's political judgment . Viewed more accurately , it is an act of political retribution . The recall petition itself expresses no evidence or allegation of ethical or criminal wrongdoing -LRB- and indeed , there has been none -RRB- and establishes a terrible precedent for our community . It is already very difficult to recruit people to run for local office ; I should know . I told both John Arena -LRB- in 2014 -RRB- and Vanessa Alvarado -LRB- in 2018 -RRB- `` no '' when they asked me to run for the Select Board . Eventually , I decided later in 2018 to undertake the effort to run for the position of Select Board member : an unpaid , time-consuming position on a Board often in the limelight for discord . I did so , despite some misgivings , because I truly do love our community and believe there is good to be done on and with the Board . But should this recall effort be successful , it will create a tremendous disincentive to run for local office . Step an inch out of line with the wishes of any given political faction in town , and you risk recall and the undoing of your own election - and more tragically , threats to your livelihood , financial security , and family 's well-being due to the attack on your personal and professional reputation . Lastly and most chillingly , this recall effort is built , at least in part , on an undercurrent of hate in our community . I have been copied on emails and have seen social media posts that utilize racist , misogynistic , or xenophobic language to characterize my colleague Vanessa . Hate does not only impact the person targeted -LRB- although it would be enough if it did -RRB- ; it tears at the fabric of a community . Personally , it has had an adverse impact on my own mental health . I know not all proponents of the recall subscribe to the same hateful playbook ; some may have actual concerns or questions about the police chief selection process . I 'm happy to speak with anyone who has such concerns . But such concerns , I would strongly suggest , would have been more appropriately raised in the regular local campaign season , when Vanessa is up for re-election , just 8 months away .

You attempted to discredit those standing up for equal rights by claiming `` they need you to be a victim so they can control you , '' and you stated to those who are oppressed that it 's their own responsibility to `` break free . '' Those words are as deeply hurtful as they are woefully misguided , and your comments expose your disregard for battles still being fought against systemic injustices . Because callousness toward injustice is not representative of our district or our community , I ask that you preserve the integrity of our school board and resign . It is obvious that we are still fighting for the basic rights of others . The Supreme Court just handed down a landmark ruling that finally acknowledges the extension of the 1964 Civil Rights Act to the LGTBQ community . Students from our district are joining the protests that have emerged in the wake of the repeated murders of unarmed black people . This is not new ; this is a moment reflective of our American tradition . The gradual , hard-fought extension of civil rights has been repeated throughout our history . The sacrifice of generations to obtain those rights , and the sacrifice of those who defend them , must never be forgotten , nor diminished by politics . This is not just your political opinion , but ultimately a denial of those rights . Systemic racism , systemic sexism , systemic homophobia , exist . Oppression has never been the result of a few bad actors . It is generations of decisions , maliciously designed institutions , conformist ideas , and daily choices we all make . Your denial of that is hurtful to our community . These experiences are not invented theories , or `` preconceived notions . '' They amount to daily threats to safety . There are examples laden in even the most basic research . Black adolescents have experienced a shocking growth of deaths by suicide in the last twenty years . They are more likely to be exposed to violence and discrimination , are far less likely to receive care than white peers and are often diagnosed differently for the same behaviors . Women in America still do not receive equal pay for equal work , face pressure to adhere to strict gender roles , and endure abhorrent rates of violence . Members of the LGTBQ community face discrimination and harassment that contribute to significantly higher rates of substance use disorder and death by suicide . Research has shown more than one in four transgender individuals have suffered a bias-driven assault , with higher levels for trans women and trans people of color . As someone who identifies as bisexual , I need you to understand your comments are wrong . I loved my time at Pennridge , but I was afraid to explore who I was ; I feared rhetoric like yours , I did n't join the Gay Straight Alliance out of a concern I could be labeled or targeted , and I felt from a young age I 'd be disadvantaged if I did n't `` fit in . '' Today I am a man who has learned to understand his identity in his 20s , only after overcoming intense challenges . My experience is far from unique . The youth I am honored to work with in Bucks County are often students of color and LGBTQ . They will tell you these are systemic problems that will take all of us to solve . Your rejection of this is a rejection of our experiences . Our students deserve respect from those overseeing their education and well-being . Our youth need to see those in power held to the standard they are expected to hold . For the sake of our Pennridge community , Ms. Cullen , please resign .

The letter said the health department received a call on June 13 from a concerned citizen who said several downtown bars were operating in violation of local regulations . On the same day , health officials said they saw bar-goers standing in each of the businesses with no attempts made by employees to maintain social distancing among customers . The letter said it appeared that the bars each surpassed 75 % of capacity . The health department has n't issued any warnings since the four sent earlier this month . A rule adopted by the Gallatin County health board said all patrons at bars must have a place to sit -- standing and mingling at the bar or elsewhere is prohibited . The rule said people should not sit within 6 feet of a well or taps or an area where drinks are passed to servers or other places used to prepare or serve food and drinks . The rule allows a designated area , away from other customers , where bar patrons may order and receive drinks . However , the rule said , people should return to their seats once a person has received their drink and must adhere to strict social distancing guidelines . Kelley said that each bar owner sent the health department a plan on how their business would further prevent violations . He said health officials inspected the bars the week after the letters were sent and saw improvements . Kelley said the health department would continue to make sure businesses follow the emergency rule . `` We ca n't be everywhere all at once , but we 're going to continue to do spot checks and do what we can to encourage compliance , '' he said . Each of the four bar owners responded to the warning letters with a list of ways to prevent violating the health rules . In the letters , the bar owners said , employees would enforce social distancing , chairs and tables would be spaced 6 feet apart and patrons would be required to sit at a table with their parties . Mike Schaff , with the American Legion , said the people working the night of the violations were not doing their jobs and that there were too many customers `` mingling around . '' He said the bar recently had an employee meeting and agreed to take out some seating , shut down the pool table and properly enforce the health rule . Schaff said he wanted his bar to be part of the solution , not the problem , and is trying to abide by the rules . `` We broke the rules and we 're trying to fix it , '' he said . Chad Yurashak , owner of Bar IX , said in a letter that the bar would train security staff to keep track of capacity so that the bar would stay within its limits . He said that most things listed were already implemented since the bar was allowed to reopen . `` However , formally trained security staff has not been needed until recently , '' Yurashak said . An unsigned letter from the Pour House said the bar has taped off the south and east sides of the bar . The letter said that standing bar-goers would be asked to return to their tables where an employee would take their orders . Attorney Brian Ortega responded to the county 's warning letter on behalf of the Crystal Bar and said the bar would have up to 40 chairs inside , below the bar 's 75 % capacity of roughly 65 people , and require people to sit . `` If any patron is standing , then staff will make any patron return to their seat or that patron will be asked to leave , '' Ortega wrote .", "seg_content_paragraph_starts": "0 27 65 103 177 251 267 335 384 423 439 472 533 596 622 639 690 708 752 798", "simhash": "b1b3555946f502bc5e26c457fa1558da", "spacy_content_loc": ["Gallatin County", "Bozeman", "The Gallatin City-County Health Department", "the Crystal Bar", "Gallatin County", "the Crystal Bar"], "spacy_content_num": ["four", "75 %", "four", "6 feet", "four", "6 feet", "up to 40", "75 %", "roughly 65"], "spacy_content_org": ["Bar IX", "the Pour House", "the American Legion", "the American Legion", "Schaff", "Bar IX", "the Pour House"], "spacy_content_otr": [], "spacy_content_per": ["Matt Kelley", "Kelley", "Kelley", "Mike Schaff", "Chad Yurashak", "Yurashak", "Brian Ortega", "Ortega"], "spacy_content_tim": ["earlier this month", "June 17", "Monday", "June 13", "June 13", "the same day", "earlier this month", "the week", "the night"], "spacy_title_loc": ["Gallatin County", "Bozeman"], "spacy_title_num": [], "spacy_title_org": [], "spacy_title_otr": [], "spacy_title_per": [], "spacy_title_tim": [], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"PoliticsGovernment": 0.5060125589370728}, "second_cat": {"PoliticsGovernment_Municipal": 0.5060125589370728}}, "title_c_count": 10, "tpc_m": {"t354": 0.21864533424377441}, "url": "https://www.bozemandailychronicle.com/coronavirus/gallatin-county-health-officials-issue-warnings-to-downtown-bozeman-bars/article_34668d42-4451-55b2-bb1b-e3009a18f470.html"}

A lower cap figure would mean less money for the Wizards to spend , but they remain very motivated to keep Bertans , NBC Sports Washington was told . What Bertans will ultimately receive in average annual value is unclear , but league sources still expect him to fall in the $ 15-20 million per year range , as the Athletic reported in December , before the league shut down . Davis Bertans appeared in 54 games for the Wizards in 2019-20 . He chose not to play in the Disney bubble since he has torn his ACL twice and was fearful of getting hurt ahead of his free agency . This is a big offseason for Bertans , as he 's expected to get the largest NBA contract of his career . He averaged 15.4 points , 4.5 rebounds and 1.7 assists in 2019-20 and shot 43.4 percent from the field , 42.4 percent from beyond the arc and 85.2 percent from the free-throw line .

League sources told ESPN and USA Today Sports on Monday that Los Angeles is close to finalizing a deal with Smith . According to ESPN , the veteran sharpshooter and the Lakers have been in contract negotiations since starting guard Avery Bradley opted out of the season . Bradley informed the Lakers last week that he wo n't play in the restart because of coronavirus concerns . According to ESPN , the guard said he had concerns about his 6-year-old son 's history with respiratory illnesses . Smith , 34 , has n't appeared in an NBA game since Nov. 2018 with the Cavaliers . He had a workout for the Lakers in February , but the team decided to sign Dion Waiters . The then-New Orleans Hornets selected Smith in the first round of the 2004 NBA Draft out of St. Benedict 's Prep in New Jersey . Across 15 seasons with the Denver Nuggets , New York Knicks , Cavs and Hornets , he has averaged 12.5 points and 3.2 rebounds per game .

But he also told senators on Friday that he has no plans to restore curbside mail collection boxes or high-speed sorting machines that have been removed . He said he actually did n't know they were being removed on his watch until the recent outcry but insisted they 're not needed . President Donald Trump has repeatedly railed against the idea of widescale mail-in voting , which many states are encouraging because of the coronavirus epidemic . The House has been called into a rare Saturday session to vote on billions of dollars in emergency help for the Postal Service . But the White House issued a veto threat on Friday for House Democrats ' proposed bill that would provide $ 25 billion to the U.S. Postal Service . It is not likely to be considered in the Republican-controlled Senate . CDC says incidence more than triple among Native Americans The coronavirus pandemic has had a disproportionate impact on Native American communities . The incidence of COVID-19 cases among American Indians and Alaska Natives was 3.5 times that among White people , according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . The latest numbers More than 5.6 million Americans have been infected and at least 175,000 have died , according to Johns Hopkins University . The CDC said Wednesday that it has provided more than $ 200 million in COVID-19 funding to American Indian and Alaska Native communities to support pandemic preparedness and responsive efforts , such as surveillance , laboratory capacity and infection control . `` American Indian and Alaska Native people have suffered a disproportionate burden of COVID-19 illness during the pandemic , '' CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield said in a news release . `` This funding approach will broaden access to COVID-19 resources across tribal communities . '' Deaths should decline across US by next week , CDC chief says COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. should start dropping around parts of the country by next week as Americans stick to mitigation efforts that help curb the spread of the virus , according to Redfield . Mitigation measures like controlling crowds and shutting down bars work , Redfield said Thursday , but it takes time until they 're reflected in the numbers . `` It is important to understand these interventions are going to have a lag , that lag is going to be three to four weeks , '' Redfield said in an interview with the Journal of the American Medical Association . `` Hopefully this week and next week you 're going to start seeing the death rate really start to drop . '' The daily average of new cases in the U.S. has been on the decline for weeks . But Redfield warned that while officials have observed cases fall across red zones in the country , cases in yellow zones across the heart of the U.S. are n't falling . `` Middle America right now is getting stuck , '' he said . `` That is why it 's so important for Middle America to recognize the mitigation that we talked about ... it 's for Middle America too , the Nebraskas , the Oklahomas . '' `` We do n't need to have a third wave in the heartland right now , '' he said . `` We need to prevent that . '' Superspeading events help drive pandemic In rural areas , superspreading events have been especially important in helping drive the pandemic , researchers in Georgia said this week . Superspreading events like parties , conferences and large gatherings have been cautioned against by leaders throughout the country . Earlier this month , experts raised concern about a motorcycle rally in a small South Dakota town which was expected to bring tens of thousands of visitors . Biostatistician Max Lau of Emory University and a team analyzed Georgia health department data in more than 9,500 COVID-19 cases in four metro Atlanta-area counties and Dougherty County in rural southwestern Georgia between March and May . `` Overall , about 2 % of cases were directly responsible for 20 % of all infections , '' they wrote in their report . Younger people were more likely to spread the virus than people over 60 , the Georgia study showed . In Ohio , the governor said that while the state has seen a significant decrease in cases across urban areas , infections have increased in rural areas . `` Spread is primarily , we 're seeing in social situations , family gatherings where people are unmasked , and in close contact and basically let their guard down , '' Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said Thursday . Administrators prepared for COVID-19 changes . Students partied anyway As thousands of students return to campuses , and in spite of the risks , some are proving the urge to socialize and party too tempting to resist . Duncan Donahue is a junior at the University of Notre Dame living off campus . He describes refreshing his university 's COVID-19 case tracking dashboard as `` harrowing . '' Now that his university halted in-person classes for two weeks in an attempt to curtail the rising number of COVID-1 cases , which have surpassed 300 as of Thursday , Donahue has mixed feelings about the parties his classmates threw . `` We 've all been cooped up for six months and not been able to enjoy certain social events that we normally do . And so , I think that for a lot of students , coming back to Notre Dame was sort of like a chance to return to normalcy '' Donahue told CNN . `` Obviously that 's a terrible idea , but I sympathize with the idea . '' When Notre Dame President Rev. John I. Jenkins , C.S.C announced the university 's decision , he addressed why students so far had not been punished for reporting parties . `` We have a policy that information gained through such inquiries will not be used in any disciplinary action . We will continue to adhere to this policy because we want students to be forthright with us , so that we can discover the source of the infections in order to keep the community safe '' Jenkins said on Tuesday . `` If , however , we learn a serious violation of our policies from other sources we will take disciplinary action '' Jenkins added , stating that several reports of this nature have already been submitted and are under review by the university conduct process . Several students at the University of Connecticut were evicted from their dorms when the university learned that students had an unapproved party that ignored social distancing rules in a residence hall . `` It 's something everyone coming back to campus knew would happen , '' editor-in-chief of the Daily Campus , UConn 's student newspaper , Peter Fenteany told CNN about the parties . `` But it 's not something that I expected on the first weekend . '' At Syracuse University in New York , Vice Chancellor for Strategic Initiatives and Innovation J. Michael Haynie wrote a letter on Thursday admonishing students after learning about a party on campus . `` Last night , a large group of first-year students selfishly jeopardized the very thing that so many of you claim to want from Syracuse University -- that is , a chance at a residential college experience , '' Haynie wrote . `` I say this because the students who gathered on the Quad last night may have done damage enough to shut down campus ... before the academic semester even begins . '' Haynie referred to the behavior of the partiers as `` selfish and unsettling '' and said that the university 's Department of Public Safety is reviewing security camera video to try to identify students who were there . `` The world is watching , and they expect you to fail . Prove them wrong . Be better . Be adults , '' he wrote . Penn State University President Thursday warned gatherings on campus of those not wearing masks or practicing physical distancing is unacceptable and will not be tolerated after reports and video surfaced of students appearing to flout campus rules amid the pandemic . A video obtained by CNN appears to show college students gathered on Penn State campus Wednesday evening -- appearing in close proximity . Masks are visible on some of the students seen from a distance in the video provided to CNN . Penn State University president Eric Barron in a stern message said , `` I ask students flouting the University 's health and safety expectations a simple question : Do you want to be the person responsible for sending everyone home ? '' Stop the spread of COVID-19 To help stop the spread of the coronavirus , the CDC recommends wearing a face mask . Masks are required in public places in some states and businesses . Multiple major retailers have announced mask requirement policies as the nation continues to see a large number of cases reported in certain areas . The CDC also recommends you keep 6 feet of distance between yourself and others . Make sure to wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and avoid touching your eyes , nose or mouth . For more tips on how to stay safe , CLICK HERE .

The New Orleans Saints knew they needed to improve their receiving corps . In 2019 , it was basically comped of Michael Thomas . He was quite frankly the only consistent threat , and that 's not an over-exaggeration . Ted Ginn Jr. and Tre'Quan Smith were on the roster , but they did n't produce much . That 's why the team went out and signed Emmanuel Sanders to a two-year deal . Sanders , who played in 49ers and torched the Saints in 2019 , will slide in as the clear No. 2 receiver . With two Pro Bowls to his name and three 1,000-yard seasons , Sanders has been graced with several of the NFL 's elite quarterbacks throughout his career . In his career , he 's been thrown to by 49ers ' Jimmy Garoppolo , Steelers ' Ben Roethlisberger and future Hall of Famer Peyton Manning . Sanders clearly knows a thing or two about top-tier quarterback play . That said , what did he think of Drew Brees after the two worked out in Denver ? `` Drew works . I love it . That guy , everyday he 's coming to work with energy , like nobody is going to outwork him . He 's the hardest-working guy and he reminds me a lot of Peyton -LRB- Manning -RRB- . And there 's a reason why those guys are great , because they work their butt off . And it 's not just from a physical standpoint , it 's from a mental standpoint as well . They 're sharp , '' Sanders told Saints ' bear writer Sam Shannon . That 's a consistent trend . Brees is that good , and he works that hard . You do n't just become the league 's completion percentage leader for three straight seasons by showing up late and putting in the bare minimum . Brees is going to retire with several NFL records , and he 's earned them . While he may not have an MVP to his name , he will be among the top-ten quarterbacks to ever throw the ball when it 's all said and done . It 's because of his hard work . Sanders saw it , and fans everywhere knew it . `` We 'll be rockin ' and rollin ' on a high level , '' Sanders said of his knowledge of the offense and the team in general . For the newly-acquired talent , hopes are high . The Big Easy is excited for this duo to take the field .

That is because he thinks he is No. 1 . On a recent episode of ESPN 's Jalen and Jacoby , Hopkins addressed the debate again . Pro Football Focus recently had Hopkins listed as an elite wideout in the slot , the second-best in the league in those situations behind only New Orleans Saints receiver Michael Thomas . As a whole , however , Hopkins is not shy to say he is the best in the game . His contention to arguments highlighting Thomas , Julio Jones of the Atlanta Falcons , among others , is that if he had a stable quarterback situation throughout his career to this point with the Houston Texans , he would have produced even more eye-popping numbers . `` I played against both of those guys last year , '' Hopkins said . `` We beat the Falcons . Obviously , we lost to the Saints on a last-second field goal toward the end of regulation . I definitely think I 'm the best . I know I 'm the best . I know Mike -LRB- Thomas -RRB- is my boy . We were texting -LSB- recently -RSB- , but he knows if I had -LRB- quarterback -RRB- Drew Brees my whole career what these numbers would be . Julio Jones , if I had -LRB- quarterback -RRB- Matt Ryan my whole career ... he knows what these numbers would be . Those guys are definitely blessed to be in a position where their whole career they had a Pro Bowl quarterback -- a quarterback that they had multiple seasons with . But I do n't complain . I do n't make excuses . I go out and work . '' Despite the signal-caller turnover , Hopkins and the Texans still amassed five AFC South division titles in the seven years he was with the franchise . In that time , Houston had 11 different quarterbacks start at least one game . Hopkins only had one season with one consistent starting gunslinger for all 16 games : Deshaun Watson in 2018 . The list is as follows , with games started in parentheses : 2013 : Matt Schaub -LRB- 8 -RRB- / Case Keenum -LRB- 8 -RRB- 2014 : Ryan Fitzpatrick -LRB- 12 -RRB- / Ryan Mallett -LRB- 2 -RRB- / Keenum -LRB- 2 -RRB- 2015 : Brian Hoyer -LRB- 9 -RRB- / Mallett -LRB- 4 -RRB- / T. J. Yates -LRB- 2 -RRB- / Brandon Weeden -LRB- 1 -RRB- 2016 : Brock Osweiler -LRB- 14 -RRB- / Tom Savage -LRB- 2 -RRB- 2017 : Savage -LRB- 7 -RRB- / Deshaun Watson -LRB- 6 -RRB- / Yates -LRB- 3 -RRB- 2018 : Watson -LRB- 16 -RRB- 2019 : Watson -LRB- 15 -RRB- / AJ McCarron -LRB- 1 -RRB- Even still , Hopkins has performed at a highly effective rate throughout his career . He has made four Pro Bowls -LRB- 2015 , 2017-19 -RRB- and is a three-time first-team All-Pro -LRB- 2017-19 -RRB- . He has garnered 8,602 yards on 632 receptions -LRB- 13.6 per catch -RRB- and 54 touchdowns on 1,048 targets . With the Cardinals , Hopkins pairs up with last season 's Offensive Rookie of the Year quarterback Kyler Murray , who the franchise is expected to ride for the foreseeable future . Not accustomed to losing , Hopkins adds to an experienced , talented wide receiver corps that already featured likely Hall of Famer Larry Fitzgerald and budding star Christian Kirk . After a five-win campaign a year ago , the addition of Hopkins immediately boosts the franchise 's odds for a more successful season .

We 've been coming here every weekend and taking food home , '' longtime customer Rex Burchett said .

On Tuesday , the longstanding Mexican restaurant re-opened its dining room to customers . `` This was not a political statement . We thought we were able to open , '' owner Kelley Chagolla said . Per Governor Polis ' order , restaurants are still required -- state-wide -- to stay closed , with the exception of delivery and carry-out . Chagolla and her son , Harrison , were hearing otherwise -- specific to Weld County . They say they reached out to county officials for clarification . `` They did n't say ` you have our blessing to open up . ' But they said , ` we 're not going to shut you down . There 's nothing stopping you from opening up . ' You we decide let 's go for it , '' Harrison Chagolla , the restaurant 's general manager , said . In a statement released by a Weld County spokesperson on Friday , they told FOX31 : `` The owners did not reach out to county officials . General guidance for businesses was released April 23 . '' But Chagolla and her son insist they spoke with multiple people from the county , including the health department , before deciding to reopen . `` The gentleman said ` yes , Weld County says you can open up . We 're open at this point , ' and gave us all the due diligence that we used to go through , '' they told FOX31 . Governor Polis ' office could not be reached for comment . Currently , the family-owned business is operating at about a quarter of their capacity . `` The other side of the restaurant -- we 're doing every other table , to make sure there 's the minimum 6 feet between tables , to keep with the social distancing we 're told should be there , '' Harrison Chagolla said . He says they can only seat about seven tables at a time . Customers hope this is the start of returning to `` normal . '' `` We would come here with two of our other friends and always sit at the same table and always have the same waitress , '' Burchett said . Harrison Chagolla says the county has warned them they 're not sure how the City of Greeley will react .

The Castle 's History Camp , which typically takes place on-site for one week each summer , went entirely virtual this year to provide campers a safe , fun , and educational experience that they could enjoy from the comfort of their own home . In order to follow social distancing guidelines for the state of Ohio , The Castle had to cancel much of its spring programming and limit tours to smaller groups by appointment only . `` We wanted to make sure we were able to social distance and make the best choices for the safety of our patrons , '' said Kyle Yoho , Education Director . `` With the guidelines set forth for day camps , it became clear to us that we would not be able to have a similar experience to what we have been able to offer in the past . '' Museum staffed weighed their options . Rather than run the camp at half-capacity and risk exposure , they chose to move the entire camp to a virtual platform . Ultimately , they felt this was the safest option for campers , staff , volunteers , and presenters . Yoho also worried that by having to enforce strict social distancing guidelines , campers might not have an enjoyable experience . `` The situation was ever-changing and evolving , '' said Yoho . `` Guidelines came out but did n't come out quickly enough for us to make decisions about what our camp was going to look like given our time frame . '' From a planning and logistics perspective , he said it was nearly impossible to plan for a physical camp . By moving to virtual , they knew they would be able to make it work . We got to see campers interact with parents , grandparents , and family members . Moving online also made the camp more accessible to people who might not have physically attended in the past . Yoho said they had campers from not only all across Ohio , but also from Florida , Nevada , and even British Columbia . While the camp was virtual , the museum made sure the sessions were still hands-on and interactive . Campers were involved , up , moving , doing things throughout the day . `` It was a cool experience to try hands-on programming in a new way , '' said Yoho . `` When we did a cooking program , for instance , we got to see campers interact with parents , grandparents , and family members . Even though we were n't physically with them , we could see how much they were enjoying it , it was a nice extension to be able to include members of their family . '' The shift also allowed the museum to work with presenters who may not have normally been able to travel to camp . This year 's presenters included professional musicians , tin-type photography artists , historians , and experienced interpreters . In total , there were twenty unique sessions that took place over the course of a week . While fewer campers participated this summer , Yoho said those who did embraced the change . `` Our campers were phenomenal , they really took to the format and enjoyed the learning experience , '' he said . `` It was rewarding to see them engaging with it , especially after going through all of the planning and training ourselves how to create this virtual experience . It blew my mind how smoothly everything went and everyone 's enthusiasm during this time of transition . '' Feedback from campers was overwhelmingly positive . Parents appreciated that the classes were hands-on and easy to manage while working from home during the pandemic . `` This is her first year and she loved the camp , '' shared one parent , on behalf of their daughter . `` I would like to see her be able to attend onsite in the future , she really loved all of the sessions . '' They were really excited to learn and that made us happier that we put in the effort to put together a quality , virtual experience . To prepare for a virtual camp , The Castle 's staff had to learn about video recording equipment , how to record live sessions with campers , how to stage sets -- Yoho said it became almost like a TV or movie production . `` Now that we know how to do these things , we will definitely utilize these tools in the future . '' Even after the pandemic when events can physically be hosted at The Castle again , Yoho believes there will always be a virtual component to programs to increase access for the community . In fact , they 've already moved their Third Thursday talks to a virtual platform and are considering additional virtual programs this fall . Despite the challenges of a global pandemic and a steep , digital learning curve , Yoho is grateful for the experience and said the smiles on campers ' faces made it all worthwhile . `` They were really excited to learn and that made us happier that we put in the effort to put together a quality , virtual experience . '' Transitioning to virtual required three times the amount of work in a much shorter time period , a shift that would not have been possible without the help of dedicated volunteers and a willingness to learn . `` We had a great volunteer group who became our tech people who helped monitor our online learning and aided with filming and recording sessions . '' At the end of the day , Virtual History Camp went off without a hitch , making The Castle one of the first organizations in the state to successfully move an in-person summer camp online .", "seg_content_paragraph_starts": "0 79 183 252 331 346 390 422 502 560 646 720 746 812 869 931 995", "simhash": "ff88b79c68778069b38c56460d3c32d3", "spacy_content_loc": ["History Camp", "Ohio", "Yoho", "Yoho", "Ohio", "Florida", "Nevada", "British Columbia", "Yoho", "Yoho", "Yoho", "Yoho"], "spacy_content_num": ["twenty", "one", "Third", "three"], "spacy_content_org": ["Castle", "Castle", "Castle", "Castle"], "spacy_content_otr": [], "spacy_content_per": ["Kyle Yoho", "Yoho", "Yoho"], "spacy_content_tim": ["summer", "one week", "this year", "day", "the day", "year", "a week", "this summer", "her first year", "Thursday", "this fall"], "spacy_title_loc": [], "spacy_title_num": [], "spacy_title_org": [], "spacy_title_otr": [], "spacy_title_per": [], "spacy_title_tim": [], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"Society": 0.7994335889816284}, "second_cat": {"Society_Relationships": 0.7994335889816284}, "third_cat": {"Society_Relationships_Other": 0.7994335889816284}}, "title_c_count": 5, "tpc_m": {"t492": 0.6807570457458496}, "url": "https://clutchmov.com/virtual-history-camp/"}	{"_id": "0PTOj88P", "c_word": 1402, "channels": ["Indoor^^Spaces", "Summer^^Camp", "ART", "Virtual^^Spaces", "Arts^^and^^Crafts"], "countries": "us", "date": "2020-06-29 19:45:00", "domain": "martinsvillebulletin.com", "epoch": {"$numberLong": "1593459900"}, "geotag": [{"name": "martinsville", "score": 0.9961508512496948, "coord": "36.691526,-79.872539", "pid": "martinsville,virginia", "type": "city"}], "highlightkeyword_list": [["Piedmont^^Arts", 0.30685711241894165], ["Walters^^Steele", 0.20627746614677764], ["Susan^^Sabin", 0.016092312891071034], ["Philpott^^Lake", 0.0039043579550181095], ["Reynolds^^Homestead", 0.0022492313066084543], ["Heidi^^Pinkston", 0.001838354619561223], ["Meritha^^Rucker", 0.001236275347755476], ["Ralph^^Northam", 5.234554756260927E-4], ["Martinsville", 1.0621503606633728E-6]], "kw_title": ["Martinsville", "summer^^camps", "virtual^^art^^camp", "summer^^classes", "summer^^camp", "in-person^^camps"], "kws": ["Martinsville", "summer^^camps", "virtual^^art^^camp", "indoor^^spaces", "summer^^classes", "summer^^camp", "Piedmont^^Arts", "Rock^^Spring^^Plantation", "in-person^^camps", "campers", "amazing^^artwork", "virtual^^classes", "virtual^^programs", "gallery", "crafts", "gatherings", "Reynolds^^Homestead", "famous^^artists", "instructors", "students"], "ne_content_location": {"Philpott Lake": 1, "Martinsville": 1, "Spencer-Penn Centre": 1, "Critz": 1}, "ne_content_organization": {"Spencer-Penn Centre Executive": 1, "Piedmont Arts": 5, "Reynolds Homestead": 1, "Uptown Rotary Club": 1}, "ne_content_person": {"Meritha Rucker": 1, "Ralph Northam": 1, "Rucker": 3, "Sabin": 8, "Heidi Pinkston": 1, "Susan Sabin": 1, "Walters Steele": 3, "Julie Walters Steele": 1}, "ne_title_location": {"Martinsville": 1}, "ne_title_organization": {}, "ne_title_person": {}, "paragraph_count": 37.0, "predicate_content": ["are", "is", "'s", "caused", "gone", "`", "governor", "said", "were", "filled", "wants", "were", "were", "gave", "limited", "sanitized", "made", "sit", "said", "have", "was", "contacted", "created", "said", "`", "said", "Providing", "grasped", "are", "said", "meant", "provides", "receives", "said", "came", "said", "noted", "said", "said", "noted", "'s"], "predicate_title": ["have"], "seg_content": "Special to The Bulletin Summer usually is filled with squeals of delight , a stampede of running feet and gasps of wonder as , this late into June , camps across the region typically are in full swing .

Limitations on gatherings , requirements for how to manage groups and extensive safety practices have caused those who organize and produce summer camps to be able to do things differently and not give up . Some have gone to virtual programs to limit access to their facilities , but Piedmont Arts in Martinsville actually decided to go forward with an in-person session -- although it was quite different from the usual . `` When the governor -LSB- Ralph Northam -RSB- moved the commonwealth into Phase Two , and after much deliberation , we decided to have in-person camps , '' Executive Director Heidi Pinkston said . `` We were not sure we were going to be able to have the camps until the last minute .

'' Piedmont Arts ' staff limited the number of campers from a typical 15 per class to six , planned as many activities outside as possible and limited points of touch . Staff also sanitized indoor spaces each day after camp . They made sure the camp went on as scheduled . The mere thought of not having a summer camp did n't sit well with Spencer-Penn Centre Executive Director Susan Sabin , who had instructed camps long before she assumed the facility 's leadership role . `` Spencer-Penn has been a hub of educational and cultural events since it was built in the 1920s , '' Sabin said . `` We have so many resources that the thought of not supporting our youth in their growth and learning at a time when so much of their world has turned upside down just was n't an option for me . '' Sabin tirelessly contacted instructors to gauge the interest of offering summer camp in a modern format , which would allow for physical distancing while still giving kids a chance to learn a new skill in a dynamic way . Together , Sabin and a group of instructors created an idea for a virtual camp . She said she checked with other local facilities offering summer camps to ensure there would n't be any overlap in programs . `` If we can all work together to fill in the gaps , we all will come out stronger and that 's obviously what we 've tried to do , '' Sabin said . Providing the tools Sabin did n't let the limitations of what traditionally would and would not be thought of as an online course stop her . Instead , she grasped the opportunity to implement new and creative ideas . `` Classes are now an hour instead of three , which means we can make a class out of something we may not have been able to do before . It also means that sometimes we have to get creative with what they have at home and prepare enough supplies that anything they may not have can be picked up from the center , '' Sabin said . `` This has meant that we are also increasing our supply costs to provide each student with their own items , but we have broken the classes down so that the students are basically just paying for their supplies . '' For example , the Spencer-Penn Centre 's acrylic painting class provides students with all of the tools they need to complete a piece of art . Each child receives full-sized paints and other supplies , allowing them to continue creating even after the class ends . `` It seems like a great way to encourage students to keep using what they 've learned and continue to grow their new abilities , '' Sabin said . Even though it 's not the same as an in-person class , the center came through for the local kids this summer . `` I certainly miss having the students in the building right now , but I 'm excited that we are able to offer some virtual learning opportunities -- and we are working on some ideas to make up for this once we are fully able to open again , '' Sabin said . Virtual opportunities Julie Walters Steele , director of Reynolds Homestead in Critz , noted that the restrictions brought about by the pandemic in the summer months were particularly difficult because that 's usually a bustling time at Rock Spring Plantation . She said she quickly got to work asking those interested in teaching summer classes what they thought about offering the courses online . `` We had instructors who were willing to develop classes virtually , and we have students that are registering , '' Walters Steele said . Walters Steele noted that the online classes are n't only geared toward children . Scheduled through the end of July , there 's a virtual art show , virtual art camp concentrating on texture , a virtual girls ' leadership camp and more . `` We 've been doing a lot of virtual classes , '' Walters Steele said . `` It 's one way we can keep our community engaged . '' Being safe is important The half-dozen kids at Piedmont Arts were more traditional . They made crafts , created artwork and drew inspiration from the galleries and famous artists . But not everything was normal . With the staff and the students wearing colorful , kid-friendly face coverings provided by the Uptown Rotary Club and keeping 6 feet away from others when possible , Meritha Rucker , summer art camp instructor , took the safety precautions seriously . `` Students are encouraged to wash and sanitize their hands after each activity and tables are sanitized between each activity as well , '' Rucker said . `` All materials are sanitized after each use . '' She said with the safety measurements in place students who had finished their school years in isolation were eager to work with each other . `` Creativity thrives when students are able to work together and physically create alongside each other . It is something that is not easily replaced through a virtual realm . Having a small group is beneficial as students can receive any help and all the materials they need to create the projects , '' Rucker said . `` I think one of the highlights so far has been our paintings of a nightscape of Philpott Lake and tie-dyed bandanas . With the smaller group , every student was able to follow along and use individual materials with minimal distractions and created some beautiful pieces of art . They have learned new techniques and skills that they can carry with them through the rest of their life . '' Piedmont Arts 's staff did scrap plans to host the usual camp-ending art show displaying the campers ' work to friends and family members . `` We chose not to do a closing reception due to restrictions and precautions , but with the smaller group , students have been consistently giving one another feedback and encouragement throughout art camp . We have done gallery walks during class , so students can see what others are creating and when parents come to pick up their children there is always a show and tell so each student can show off their creations , '' Rucker said . `` Seeing one 's art in a gallery setting does build a sense of confidence and encourages individuals to continue creating . I am confident the students ' time in art camp will inspire them to continue producing amazing artwork .

'' -- From `` Autumn Day '' by Hattie Tyng Griswold , American poet -LRB- 1840-1909 -RRB- . These lines sound very appealing right now , as this weather and month is my favorite , and the suggestion almost sounds like a vacation . The hummingbirds are still visiting throughout the day , along with goldfinches and many varieties of woodpeckers . Once in a while we are getting invaded by families of wild turkeys , but they are more tame than wild . The dog just ignores them , and the cat seems content to just stalk them , but is careful not to confront them at all . September brings new flowers as old ones fade away , but each day brings us some beauty and blessings . My 18-month-old great-grandson Noah is recovering nicely with his mom in Boston after minor but successful surgery at Children 's Hospital . He has to remain there one more week , and then he will be able to return home here to keep us on our toes with his talents as an escape artist . We have been so blessed with all of the help offered and given by so many people to assist in caring for Noah 's two brothers and sister while their mom is off-Island . Bless all your hearts . I spoke with Rose Cogliano recently , and she assured me that although the Oak Bluffs Council on Aging building is still closed to the public , staff members are still available to answer questions and assist anyone who needs help . If no one answers the phone , just leave a message , and someone will get back to you . Rose and other staff are looking forward to the time when you can all gather together in person and continue participating in all the activities the center offers . Condolences to the family and friends of Dennis daRosa , who passed last week . He was a kind person who was always happy to assist customers in his store , and worked diligently in support of our town and the business community . But most of all he was a good friend to many , husband , father , and loving grandfather . We are so sorry . Bob Dutton ` s death last week left his many friends saddened by this loss . Well-known as the theater manager at the M.V. Film Center and a playwright , this talented man will be so missed . We send condolences to his wife Molly Conole and all who loved him . Congratulations to one of Oak Bluffs ' most popular couples : Penny and Manny deBettencourt will be celebrating 45 years of marriage on Sept. 6 . They have three children , Adam , Lana , and Deanna , and a grandson , Ansel . We wish you continued happiness in the years ahead . Nick Rivers and Melissa Kallager had planned their wedding for the past year , but , you guessed it , COVID-19 disrupted their well-organized plans , as it has for so many others . A small group of friends held a bridal shower for Melissa this past Sunday at her future sister-in-law Melanie Rivers ' home , bringing some cheer in these somewhat gloomy times . Their wedding will still take place in October as planned , but limited to 25 people . Happier times are coming . Please keep being kind and helpful with one another . It works . We send birthday smiles to Judy Cunnuffe on Sept. 5 , Skylar Hall on the 6th , Holly Hawkes and Susan Phillips on the 7th , and Ryan Araujo on the 10th . Enjoy your week . Peace .

That order will expire Friday . Governor Holcomb last week added more federal aid money to a state rental assistance fund for people having trouble making their payments because the pandemic took a bite out of their paychecks . It 's now a $ 40 million fund for everyone except Marion County , which set up its own program . Fair Housing Center of Central Indiana executive director Amy Nelson says she 's concerned the state is ending the eviction moratorium too soon . She says the assistance programs , funded by the federal pandemic-relief CARES Act , just got started a month ago , and it 's unclear how many of the 41,000 applications have been fully processed . Marion County suspended new applications for its program after a deluge of requests beyond the 10,000 it budgeted for . The Indiana Housing and Community Development Authority says nearly half the applications statewide are from Lake , Saint Joseph , Allen , Tippecanoe and Vanderburgh Counties . The Indiana Supreme Court and Indiana Bar Foundation are working on a program to help landlords and tenants settle out of court , with the potential to keep the lease going . Nelson says she 's waiting to see the details of that program . But she predicts legal aid organizations will be overwhelmed by people needing help with eviction cases . She says she 'd like to see the state put a single point person in charge overseeing pandemic-related housing issues . Nelson says predicting how many evictions will be sought when the moratorium is lifted is `` uncharted territory . '' But she warns even if you do n't end up losing your home , having an eviction case filed against you can mar your credit history and make it harder to get a lease for years afterward . One of President Trump 's executive orders over the weekend imposes a federal ban on evictions and foreclosures , but that only applies to public housing and buildings with federal mortgages . That 's about a quarter of rentals nationwide .", "seg_content_paragraph_starts": "0 35 89 169 196 279 337 354", "simhash": "6fc04998017f642b96d5cb1e472877f9", "spacy_content_loc": ["INDIANAPOLIS", "Marion County", "Marion County", "Lake", "Saint Joseph"], "spacy_content_num": ["$ 40 million", "41,000", "10,000", "nearly half", "One", "about a quarter"], "spacy_content_org": ["Fair Housing Center of Central Indiana", "The Indiana Housing and Community Development Authority", "The Indiana Supreme Court", "Indiana Bar Foundation", "Trump"], "spacy_content_otr": [], "spacy_content_per": ["Holcomb", "Amy Nelson", "Allen", "Tippecanoe", "Vanderburgh Counties", "Nelson", "Nelson"], "spacy_content_tim": ["Friday", "last week", "a month ago", "years", "the weekend"], "spacy_title_loc": [], "spacy_title_num": [], "spacy_title_org": [], "spacy_title_otr": [], "spacy_title_per": [], "spacy_title_tim": ["Friday"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"BusinessEconomy": 0.9998345971107483, "Society": 0.9944396018981934}, "second_cat": {"BusinessEconomy_RealEstate": 0.9998345971107483, "Society_Advocacy": 0.9944396018981934}, "third_cat": {"Society_Advocacy_Other": 0.9944396018981934, "BusinessEconomy_RealEstate_Other": 0.9998345971107483}}, "title_c_count": 4, "tpc_m": {"t459": 0.3567652702331543, "t635": 0.2048681527376175}, "url": "https://www.wibc.com/news/coronavirus/eviction-moratorium-expires-friday/"}	{"_id": "0PT8TPuG", "c_word": 1153, "channels": ["Housing", "For^^Rent", "Homeowners", "Federal^^Assistance", "Federal^^Funding"], "countries": "us", "date": "2020-06-29 16:37:49", "domain": "stamfordadvocate.com", "epoch": {"$numberLong": "1593448669"}, "geotag": [], "highlightkeyword_list": [["Ned^^Lamont", 0.9942226792125831], ["Housing^^Committee", 0.07225983880102763], ["Saud^^Anwar", 0.04038818210706602], ["Brandon^^McGee", 0.0016067759596386526], ["housing", 2.2643992676072602E-6], ["Connecticut", 8.246865935566025E-7]], "kw_title": ["housing", "evictions", "Housing^^Committee", "approved^^tenant^^applicants", "eviction^^proceedings", "Gov.^^Ned^^Lamont"], "kws": ["housing", "residential^^landlords", "tenants", "evictions", "Housing^^Committee", "rent^^relief", "approved^^tenant^^applicants", "renters", "rental^^assistance^^program", "homeowners", "mortgage^^relief", "foreclosures", "low-income^^households", "federal^^grants", "emergency^^assistance", "eviction^^proceedings", "eviction-prevention^^funding", "units", "low-income^^tennats", "Gov.^^Ned^^Lamont"], "ne_content_location": {"South Windsor": 1, "D-Hartford": 1, "Connecticut": 2, "New England": 2}, "ne_content_organization": {"Department of Housing": 1, "Senate": 1, "Department of Housing During": 1, "Housing Committee": 2, "General Assembly 's Housing Committee": 1, "General Assembly": 1}, "ne_content_person": {"Saud Anwar": 1, "Mosquera-Bruno": 2, "Ned Lamont": 2, "Lamont": 4, "McGee": 1, "Anwar": 5, "Brandon McGee": 1}, "ne_title_location": {}, "ne_title_organization": {}, "ne_title_person": {"Lamont": 1}, "paragraph_count": 28.0, "predicate_content": ["announced", "includes", "meant", "questioned", "said", "'s", "said", "working", "said", "includes", "be", "be", "help", "include", "•", "million", "•", "million", "•", "million", "•", "million", "•", "Extending", "Source", "told", "said", "`", "said", "admitted", "going", "going", "have", "believe", "replied", "putting", "appears", "is", "stressed", "said", "said"], "predicate_title": ["extends"], "seg_content": "Tenants , homeowners and residential landlords will share at least $ 33 million in state and federal grants to avoid evictions and foreclosures , Gov. Ned Lamont announced on Monday . The program also includes extending the governor 's executive order on evictions , set to expire July 1 , through the month of August . The moves were meant to address a coronavirus-inflicted crisis as Lamont 's stay on evictions expires Tuesday , and also make a dent in longer term housing issues . But a co-chairman of the General Assembly 's Housing Committee , Democratic state Sen. Saud Anwar , questioned whether the funding is enough in Connecticut , which he called `` the most-segregated in New England . '' `` We know that some renters and homeowners are having a hard time paying the costs of their housing , '' Lamont said in a written statement Monday morning . `` It 's critical that we provide emergency help so that they can stay housed , and to support residential landlords , many of who are mom-and-pop small businesses themselves . '' During his late-afternoon news conference , Lamont said he would announce more funding for rental assistance later in the week . `` We 'll be working with landlords so the landlords can work with their tenants , and make sure that over a reasonable period of time people have a chance to get back on their feet and certainly can stay in their home without worry of eviction , '' Lamont said . The funding includes $ 10 million in payments to landlords , with the focus on owners of housing of low-income tennats without unemployment insurance , including populations of undocumented immigrants . There will also be $ 5 million to assist renters who were involved in the eviction process prior to the public health emergency was declared in March . There will be another $ 10 million for homeowners whose mortgages are not federally insured . Nearly $ 8 million would help homeless people to start renting units , and peope exiting the custody of the state Department of Correction . Information Elements of the governor 's housing assistance plan include : • A $ 10 million rental assistance program through the state Department of Housing for residents impacted by COVID-19 , to pay landlords on behalf of approved tenant applicants , with a priority on low-income households who have been denied unemployment insurance ; • $ 5 million in eviction-prevention funding to help renters who were in eviction proceedings before the coronavirus emergency was declared in March . • $ 10 million in mortgage relief to homeowners who have suffered impacts from COVID-19 , including the loss of jobs , whose mortgages are not federally insured . • $ 4 million to help homeless people afford initial rent and security deposits . • $ 2.5 million in rental assistance program for people , including the undocumented foreign-born , who are ineligible for emergency assistance through the federal CARES Act . • $ 1.8 million in funding for reentry and rehousing assistance for those leaving the state 's prison system . • Extending the residential eviction moratorium to August 25 ; and extending the option for renters to apply a portion of their security deposits toward rent . Source : Gov. Ned Lamont ; state Department of Housing During a morning meeting of the Housing Committee , Anwar , a physician from South Windsor , told state Housing Commissioner Seila Mosquera-Bruno that the planned $ 10 million for landlords `` appears to be very little , '' but the extension of the eviction moratorium `` is going to be good news . '' Mosquera-Bruno said lower-income people would be entitled to $ 4,000 in relief over 12 months , or $ 333 a month , and would be required to pay 30 percent of their income toward rent . `` We 're going to review incomes , '' she said . `` Listen , I do n't have all the answers , '' Mosquera-Bruno admitted , stressing that rent relief will be a continuing focus of the program . `` With $ 10 million we 're going to see how we can deploy the money as fast as we can with the resources that we have . We 're going to see where and who needs the resources . Certainly we have a lot of work ahead of us . I do n't believe that we can just move 100,000 from one city to a suburb . '' `` Many of the states , smaller than us from the population perspective , were looking at $ 50 million , '' Anwar replied . `` Other states were putting $ 100 million . Then $ 10 million appears very little because there are landlords that are hurting . The last thing we want to do is impact the ability to pay their mortgages . '' Rep. Brandon McGee , D-Hartford , co-chairman of the Housing Committee , stressed that tenants must notify the landlord that they have lost a job , lost hours of work , or otherwise lost revenue or faced significant increases in expenses because of COVID-19 . `` There is a lot of confusion around the current executive order that protects many of our tenants , '' McGee said . Anwar said he wants major housing issues part of the upcoming July special session of the General Assembly on police accountability in the wake of nationwide protests against racism . Senate Democrats on June 19 rolled out a sweeping set of reforms inclusing housing , criminal justice , economic development , health and education , which they said they would address in a special session this summer . `` As a physician , if we just do criminal justice alone in the special session , we 're just taking care of the symptom of a much more-complex , historical and systemic racism that has been impacting and truly plaguing our brothers and sisters in the African-American and Latino community , '' Anwar said . `` In order to try to have a comprehensive strategy , housing is a central part of it , and whether we agree with it or not , well , most of the people when they look at the data would agree that we are a segregated state , '' Anwar said . `` And I think without having a strategy for desegregation and also having legislation around it , we 're not going to be able to make the impact that is needed . I 'm hoping and praying that these recent events would have changed the hearts of our colleagues . '' He asked Mosquera-Bruno to create a wide-ranging desegregation strategy for Connecticut , `` which is the most-segregated state in the New England area right now .

'' Scott shared news of her participation in the film Wednesday , Aug. 12 . on Instagram and said she was honored to be in it . `` So so so so very excited for this film , '' wrote Scott . `` Mahalia Jackson was powerful for more than her spiritual voice ; THAT Queen Mother was determined . Every story about Mahalia Jackson is worth the watch . I feel stupendously honored . @queenlatifah & @iamjamiefoxx I 've seen and love what you 've done as Bessie Smith and Ray Charles . You believing in my talent and effort is tremendous !!! #Iknowwhatmyjobis . '' Jackson , who was born in New Orleans , Louisiana , became a global superstar long before gospel music was the mainstream draw that it is today . She was the first gospel artist to play Carnegie Hall and used her influence to help several political campaigns , including John F. Kennedy 's . She sang at Kennedy 's inaugural ball when he became president . The late singer was also an avid supporter of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the entire civil rghts movement and sang at the March on Washington in 1963 , where King gave his historic `` I Have a Dream '' speech . She passed away from heart failure in 1972 in Evergreen Park , Illinois , at 60 years old . Aretha Franklin , whom Jackson mentored , sang at her funeral . In a press statement that surfaced on Wednesday , Latifah said that she 's eager to get the story of Jackson on the silver screen and excited to connect with Holly Carter , who executive produced Lifetime 's wildly successful `` The Clark Sisters '' movie . `` This is such an incredibly important story to tell and we 're thrilled to work with Jamie on the project . Shakim and I are also looking forward to reteaming with our ` Clark Sisters ' producing partner , Holly Carter , to share Mahalia 's inspiring journey to becoming the Queen of Gospel music , '' said Latifah , mentioning her longtime business partner Shakim Compere . It was announced earlier this month that another film on Jackson is in the works called `` Robin Roberts Presents : The Mahalia Jackson Story . '' That project , which is being produced by `` Good Morning America '' co-host Robin Roberts , will star `` Orange Is the New Black '' star Danielle Brooks as Jackson and will air on Lifetime . One major difference between both films is that Latifah and Foxx 's version will have the gospel icon 's actual music in it , since they secured her entire musical catalog . Viewers of the big-screen version will be treated to songs like `` His Eyes Are on the Sparrow , '' `` Amazing Grace , '' `` Go Tell It On the Mountain , '' and Jackson 's biggest hit , `` Move on Up a Little Higher .

Jacob Ngarivhume has been in detention for a month after his arrest along with journalist Hopewell Chin ` ono on charges of inciting violence , after he called for protests on July 31 against corruption and the government 's mishandling of the economy . Critics accuse President Emmerson Mnangagwa 's government of persecuting its opponents amid the worst economic crisis in more than a decade , a charge the authorities deny . Separately on Friday , police arrested Job Sikhala , national vice chairman of the main opposition Movement for Democratic Change with inciting public violence , his lawyer said . Sikhala had said on social media he was in hiding and was among more than a dozen activists sought by law enforcement agents in relation to the anti-government protests . In February , Sikhala was acquitted of subversion charges by the courts after he was arrested last year . At the magistrates court in Ngarivhume 's case , Magistrate Trynos Utahwashe said the fact that July 31 had come and gone without the violence the state had feared was `` not sufficient to guarantee the safety of the public if the accused is granted bail '' . Ngarivhume , who arrived at court in leg irons and handcuffs , will return to court on Sept. 4 for a routine appearance . His lawyer Moses Nkomo said he was `` stunned '' by the court 's decision but would appeal at the High Court next week . Another magistrate is expected to rule on Chin ` ono 's third bail application on Monday . -LRB- Reporting by MacDonald Dzirutwe ; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Hugh Lawson -RRB-", "seg_content_paragraph_starts": "0 41 85 113 142 172 191 239 263 288 305", "simhash": "416767a3272d6782a9625b26cec5e762", "spacy_content_loc": [], "spacy_content_num": ["third", "more than a dozen", "third"], "spacy_content_org": ["HARARE", "Reuters", "Zimbabwean", "Movement for Democratic Change", "Ngarivhume", "the High Court"], "spacy_content_otr": [], "spacy_content_per": ["Jacob Ngarivhume", "Hopewell Chin", "Emmerson Mnangagwa", "Job Sikhala", "Sikhala", "Sikhala", "Trynos Utahwashe", "Ngarivhume", "Moses Nkomo", "Chin", "MacDonald Dzirutwe", "Chizu Nomiyama", "Hugh Lawson"], "spacy_content_tim": ["Friday", "last month", "a month", "July 31", "more than a decade", "Friday", "February", "last year", "July 31", "Sept. 4", "next week", "Monday"], "spacy_title_loc": ["Zimbabwe"], "spacy_title_num": ["third"], "spacy_title_org": [], "spacy_title_otr": [], "spacy_title_per": [], "spacy_title_tim": [], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"CrimePublicsafety": 1.000008225440979}, "second_cat": {"CrimePublicsafety_Other": 1.000008225440979}}, "title_c_count": 11, "tpc_m": {"t430": 0.27716681361198425, "t980": 0.15702679753303528, "t195": 0.13598346710205078}, "url": "https://wnmtradio.com/news/articles/2020/aug/21/zimbabwe-politician-who-called-for-protests-denied-bail-for-third-time/1051220/?refer-section=world"}	{"_id": "0PSrHZQV", "c_word": 202, "channels": ["Other^^Videos", "Egypt"], "countries": "us;ca;gb;au", "date": "2020-06-29 02:15:28", "domain": "nypost.com", "epoch": {"$numberLong": "1593396928"}, "geotag": [], "highlightkeyword_list": [["Sama^^el-Masry", 0.6664566986734823], ["John^^Talaat", 0.6339118952505739], ["Egypt", 2.2278643433116692E-5], ["videos", 1.4035805965465269E-5], ["prison", 6.997027510478465E-6], ["Sama", 6.988758458900304E-6]], "kw_title": ["videos", "prison"], "kws": ["videos", "prison", "Sama^^el-Masry", "debauchery", "Cairo", "Egypt", "women", "authorities", "John^^Talaat", "social", "Entessar^^el-Saeed", "crime^^law", "stolen", "April", "Post^^wires", "parliament", "Thomson^^Reuters"], "ne_content_location": {"Cairo": 1, "Egypt": 1}, "ne_content_organization": {"Thomson Reuters Foundation": 1, "Reuters": 1}, "ne_content_person": {"John Talaat": 1, "Entessar el-Saeed": 1, "El-Saeed": 1, "Talaat": 1, "Sama el-Masry": 1, "El-Masry": 3}, "ne_title_location": {}, "ne_title_organization": {}, "ne_title_person": {}, "paragraph_count": 9.0, "predicate_content": ["dancer", "sentenced", "arrested", "denied", "told", "`", "said", "said", "told", "`", "said", "With"], "predicate_title": ["sentenced"], "seg_content": "High-profile Egyptian belly dancer Sama el-Masry was sentenced to three years in prison Saturday after prosecutors said she posted sexually suggestive videos to TikTok .

Lucky are those who cruise in winter into the southeastern Utah town of Moab and discover that nearby Arches National Park is utterly crowd-free . Instead of competing with many of the more than 1.5 million annual visitors who scrabble to take in more than 2,000 spectacular natural arches , you 'll think that with so few souls about in winter that you were in your own backyard . With late-winter temperatures hovering in the mid-30s and low-40s , this wonderland that lies hard on the Colorado border is practically balmy . Of late , the old farming and potash and uranium mining town of Moab is booming with new lodging -LRB- see details at bottom -RRB- . Just as Hollywood location scouts for old western movies and `` Thelma & Louise '' knew , making Moab your base means a ten-minute breeze of a drive over the Colorado River to reach the Arches entrance . This part of the Colorado Plateau was originally inhabited by Paleo-Indians , followed by the Fremont , Ancestral Puebloans and Utes . Right off of Potash Road a few miles south of Moab , fantastic ancient petroglyphs of various animals and figures are easily spotted in the cliffs . Guide Dan Norris and his partner Tom in their company Tom Till Tours know exactly which points to take you to on a photo safari . In winter , the Moab and Arches area has night skies that are perfect for stargazing . More than a dozen locations make Utah the state with the nation 's highest number of International Dark Sky Parks , with Arches having been designated less than two years ago . Plan on arriving with a new moon for optimal stargazing and shooting the sky . Once you see the beauty of Dan 's and Tom 's own landscape and night sky photography work , your head will explode . Their company can take you as well on short sunset hikes to locales such as the Windows where patches of trail ice may slow the trek and make it less stable than in warm months , but which always make for an invigorating journey . Nearby , the popular Arches site of Balanced Rock glows red in the sunset . Seemingly teetering delicately atop a 75-foot-high stone tower , the rock is in fact the size of several buses . For an overview of the complex series of geologic events that produced the stunning arches , the Arches Visitor Center is worth a good hour tour in order to learn about the 300-million-year-old salt bed that underlies the area , as well as to understand how subsequent sandstone deposits and thrusting and uplift events shaped the land . Further exhibits detail the flora and fauna that survive in this harsh climate . You 'll be reminded too of having learned in school of John Wesley Powell 's 1869 investigative journey down the Colorado River . At the turn of the 20th century , Doc Williams somehow administered medicine to early settlers over a vast territory in the region . Today , his descendants operate NAVTEC Expeditions . Charlotte Bethurum and Brian Martinez , who in summer work a crazy seven days a week , will take you to highlights such as Delicate Arch , Landscape Arch and Park Avenue whose row of towers hint at Manhattan high-rises . The NAVTEC duo knows every inch of the park and can also share super isolated spots such as the Eye of the Whale where the setting sun in winter peers right through its arch as you approach it . As if you 'd reserved the site for yourself , you 'll likely not encounter another soul around . They will explain precisely the process of freeze and thaw cycles that produce arches , and tell you all about life forms here , from the ubiquitous junipers to the cryptobiotic soil , small crusts of earth vital to the ecosystem that hold organisms and which can take a century to form . When you spot a trail of tiny claw prints in the sand , they can pinpoint them as belonging to , say , a ring-tailed cat . National parks are artificial constructs really and just outside Arches lie more spectacular Bureau of Land Management -LRB- BLM -RRB- and private ranch lands . Marine Corps veteran and former helicopter pilot , Mike Ballard runs Big Iron Tour Co. . In one of his vehicles -- preferably a warm , covered Jeep -- Mike will take you up the narrow and meandering Onion Creek canyon , crushing crusty ice on the creek surface as you cross it over and over again . He will lace his way along the snow-covered dirt road between , and sometimes looking down , sheer cliffs until eventually the canyon opens to grazing lands where curious cattle stare at your group , the sole humans out and about this time of year . Moab-raised , Mike knows every nook and cranny out here . Driving up a ridge , he offers you the clearest views of the distant La Sal mountain range whose dozen snow-capped peaks over 12,000-feet-high really do look like salt as the Spanish name indicates -LRB- the peaks are the result of laccolith igneous rock intrusions , for the record -RRB- . Mike will recount the murky details of the deadly Pinhook Draw conflict that took place one valley over , when in 1881 native Utes and Paiutes battled with a posse of ranchers chasing them . And if you 're super lucky , you might spot a bald eagle soaring from the cliffs . Just north of Moab and Arches begins the dramatic Dead Horse Point Mesa Scenic Byway , which then turns south to winds its way up an escarpment , with the winter snow getting thicker as you arrive at the flat top . If you 're a city slicker , note that the curious bright yellow roadside signs you see with a cow illustration and the words Free Range on them indicate that you , the driver , are responsible should you hit any cattle . You 've seen pictures before of the iconic spectacular view from Dead Horse Point State Park that looks over an oxbow bend in the Green River . In the late-19th-century , cowboys would keep horses out at the narrow Dead Horse Point , some of which they never brought back down -- thus the macabre name . On a winter day , you may well find yourself gloriously all alone up here at the end of the road . Take a turn-off on your way back and you 'll land up in Canyonlands National Park , a terrain so enormous that the park is larger than some nations and would be the highlight of many other countries were it not located among Utah 's already star-studded natural landscapes . There are plenty of rough backroad areas in the park to explore in summer , but for now walk out to the ledge at spots such as Grand View Point and Shafer Trail on the Island in the Sky mesa and just marvel in the crisp winter air at the vertiginous heights and the red rock cliffs all around you . Back in Moab : For the last fifty years , the Moab Rock Shop with its rusty vintage trucks and old mining equipment out front has been a local institution . Nothing fussy about this place that is crammed with tiny fossils and massive prized rocks , all of which make it feel as much museum as shop . There 's nicely nothing too fussy either about the food on Main Street . To fortify yourself for days of national park journeys , you can take away a huge selection of lunch sandwiches , wraps and more from the Sweet Cravings bakery and deli . For dinner , wood-fired pizzas and heaping plates of pasta wait for you at the family style Antica Forma Italian restaurant . Once you pull up every morning to the cute little red hut that is the Wicked Brew Espresso Drive-Thru and fuel up on quality coffees , you 'll be good to go for another day of transcendent national park exploring . Lodging : Set quietly off of Main Street , which is also the busy Highway 191 , the brand new Hoodoo Moab , Curio Collection by Hilton has a bright and spacious lobby , behind which its Josie Wyatt 's Grille steak restaurant may be the best restaurant in town . As at the Hilton , you can lie under the winter stars in a hot tub at the Hyatt Place , the perfect way to start acclimating yourself to the 4,000-foot Colorado Plateau elevation . Coming out next month from Ten Speed Press , the illustrated book Scenic Science of the National Parks : An Explorer 's Guide to Wildlife , Geology , and Botany includes extensive material on Arches and Canyonlands national parks .", "seg_content_paragraph_starts": "0 60 104 191 266 354 434 529 602 660 740 869 984 1069 1148 1198 1259 1318 1386 1427 1429 1513", "simhash": "8b9a1b82d6fd15219c88751c05357f2f", "spacy_content_loc": ["Utah", "Moab", "Arches National Park", "low-40s", "Colorado", "Moab", "Hollywood", "the Colorado River", "the Colorado Plateau", "Fremont", "Potash Road", "Moab", "Arches", "Utah", "International Dark Sky Parks", "Balanced Rock", "the Arches Visitor Center", "the Colorado River", "Landscape Arch", "Park Avenue", "Manhattan", "the Eye of the Whale", "earth", "Onion Creek", "La Sal"], "spacy_content_num": ["more than 1.5 million", "more than 2,000", "ten-minute", "a few miles", "More than a dozen", "one", "dozen"], "spacy_content_org": ["Americans", "Paleo-Indians", "Puebloans", "Arches", "NAVTEC Expeditions", "NAVTEC", "Bureau of Land Management", "BLM", "Marine Corps", "Big Iron Tour Co.", "Jeep", "Spanish"], "spacy_content_otr": ["Thelma & Louise ''", "Moab", "Delicate Arch"], "spacy_content_per": ["Moab", "Dan Norris", "Tom", "Tom", "Dan", "Tom", "John Wesley Powell 's", "Doc Williams", "Charlotte Bethurum", "Brian Martinez", "Mike Ballard", "Mike", "Moab", "Mike"], "spacy_content_tim": ["summer", "winter", "annual", "winter", "late-winter", "mid-30s", "winter", "less than two years ago", "months", "a good hour", "year-old", "1869", "the turn of the 20th century", "Today", "summer", "a crazy seven days", "winter", "a century"], "spacy_title_loc": [], "spacy_title_num": [], "spacy_title_org": [], "spacy_title_otr": [], "spacy_title_per": ["Moab"], "spacy_title_tim": [], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"Lifestyle": 0.9901805520057678}, "second_cat": {"Lifestyle_Travel": 0.9901805520057678}, "third_cat": {"Lifestyle_Travel_TouristDestinations": 0.5888720154762268}}, "title_c_count": 13, "tpc_m": {"t346": 0.35347118973731995, "t336": 0.11730975657701492}, "url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnoseid/2020/03/03/moab-and-arches-national-park-rocking-it-in-a-utah-winter-landscape/"}	{"_id": "0PSuAMwu", "c_word": 352, "channels": ["Atlantic^^City", "Garden^^Design", "Asbury^^Park", "The^^Sun", "Wedding^^Photos"], "countries": "us", "date": "2020-06-29 10:39:06", "domain": "app.com", "epoch": {"$numberLong": "1593427146"}, "geotag": [{"name": "asbury park", "score": 0.9779232740402222, "coord": "40.220391,-74.012082", "pid": "asbury_park,new_jersey", "type": "city"}, {"name": "New Jersey", "score": 1.0, "pid": "new_jersey", "type": "state"}], "highlightkeyword_list": [["New^^Jersey", 0.9971962501058022], ["Garden^^State", 0.9943521406216811], ["Asbury^^Park", 0.9730838485029001], ["Atlantic^^City", 0.5259082237868455], ["Hannah^^Burkett", 0.12461888564615853], ["Wildwood", 2.259538715515527E-6], ["Gannett", 2.1874490783275916E-6]], "kw_title": ["Boardwalk^^culture", "indelible^^summer^^memories"], "kws": ["Boardwalk^^culture", "indelible^^summer^^memories", "Atlantic^^City", "Wildwood", "Garden^^State", "Asbury^^Park", "the^^sun", "cultural^^icons", "summers", "statues", "moments", "wedding^^photos", "caricatures", "Hollis^^Towns^^Design", "sandals", "hand-cut^^crispy^^fries", "restaurant^^trends", "entertainers", "marvel", "Gannett^^newspapers"], "ne_content_location": {"Atlantic City": 2, "Asbury Park": 1, "Garden State": 2, "New Jersey": 4, "Wildwood": 2}, "ne_content_organization": {"Garden State": 1, "Gannett": 1}, "ne_content_person": {"Tom Donovan Gannett": 1, "Hannah Burkett": 1, "Joanne Sosangelis": 1, "Kelly-Jane Cotter Joe Walsh Sarah Griesemer Bob Makin Ken Serrano Jason Alt Bill Canacci Kate Priest Jamila Robinson": 1}, "ne_title_location": {"New Jersey": 1}, "ne_title_organization": {}, "ne_title_person": {}, "paragraph_count": 25.0, "predicate_content": ["come", "is", "is", "is", "toss", "is", "celebrate", "learn", "hope", "Contributors", "Cotter", "Walsh", "Jason", "Publisher", "Gannett", "VP", "Design", "Director", "CHATTER", "made", "are"], "predicate_title": ["created"], "seg_content": "Part 2 of an Exclusive Special Series From Asbury Park to the shores of Cape May , the sights and sounds of the Garden State come alive on its boardwalks and create indelible summer memories . Boardwalk culture is the rhythmic creaking of the planks underneath a pair of sandals as it is drips from a swirled ice cream cone . It is where we climb up to see the sights on the telescopes , and watch the sun set from a park bench . The boardwalk is where we grab a carton of hand-cut crispy fries , and play games for a stuffed souvenir . We toss coins to entertainers who doo-wop , and marvel at the artists dressed like statues or who render caricatures in a matter of moments . In many New Jersey towns from Atlantic City to Wildwood , the boardwalk is the launching point for everything from wedding photos to restaurant trends . In this second in our series of premium editions -- created exclusively for the subscribers by the journalists from Gannett newspapers across the Garden State -- we celebrate the New Jersey towns from Atlantic City to Wildwood , where the boardwalk is the center of the community . Readers will learn how the boardwalks are economic drivers for the entire state , as well as cultural icons , as seen in the historic images from our archives that appear throughout the section . We hope that you enjoy this premium edition , and share your memories and images of the boardwalk on any of our social media platforms using the hashtag #ShoreSummer .
